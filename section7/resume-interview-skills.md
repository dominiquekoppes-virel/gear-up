# Resume Building & Interview Skills

**Even with limited experience, you can create a resume that gets you hired and master the interview process.**

Most high school students think they don't have anything to put on a resume. That's not true - you just need to know how to present what you do have in a professional way.

## Interview Red Flags (Don't Work Here)

Watch out for these warning signs during interviews:
- They won't tell you the pay rate
- They pressure you to start immediately without proper paperwork
- The workplace looks unsafe or unprofessional
- Employees seem unhappy or stressed
- They ask inappropriate personal questions (age, family plans, etc.)
- They want money upfront for training or uniforms

- They seem disorganized or unprepared

**Trust your instincts** - if something feels wrong, it probably is.

## Cover Letters: When and How

**Do you need a cover letter?**
- **Online applications:** Usually not unless specifically requested
- **Email applications:** Include a brief message in the email body
- **In-person applications:** Can help you stand out
- **Professional positions:** More likely to be expected

### Simple Cover Letter Template:

```
[Your Name]
[Your Phone] | [Your Email]

[Date]

[Hiring Manager Name]
[Company Name]
[Address]

Dear [Hiring Manager/Sir or Madam],

I am writing to apply for the [Job Title] position at [Company Name]. [Briefly explain how you learned about the job.]

[One paragraph about why you're interested in this job and company specifically.]

[One paragraph about what you can offer - relevant experience, skills, or qualities that make you a good fit.]

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

### Follow-up Strategy:

- **Send a brief email** or make a polite phone call
- **Express continued interest** and ask about timeline
- **Don't follow up more than twice** unless they ask you to

---

## Salary and Benefits Discussion

### Know What You're Worth:
**Research typical pay** for similar positions in your area using:
- Glassdoor.com
- Indeed.com salary tool
- PayScale.com
- Ask people in similar jobs

### For Entry-Level Positions:
- **You usually can't negotiate much** on starting salary
- **You can ask about** raises and advancement opportunities
- **Focus on** learning opportunities and schedule flexibility
- **Ask about benefits** like health insurance, paid time off, employee discounts

### Questions About Pay and Benefits:
- "What is the starting wage for this position?"
- "When would I be eligible for a raise?"
- "What benefits are available to employees?"
- "Is there opportunity for overtime pay?"
- "How flexible is the schedule?"

**Don't accept a job without knowing the pay rate** - this is a red flag.

## After the Interview

### Follow-Up Best Practices:

Subject: Thank you for the interview - [Your Name]

Please let me know if you need any additional information. I look forward to hearing about the next steps.
