# [W] Entering the Workforce: Your Practical Guide

**Ready to start working? Let's get you prepared to find a job that actually pays the bills and maybe even leads somewhere.**

Whether you're planning to jump straight into work after graduation, need a job while figuring out your next move, or want to start building work experience and money for future plans, this section will help you do it right.

**Reality Check:** Your first job probably won't be your dream job, and that's completely normal. The goal is to start somewhere that pays you fairly, teaches you skills, and doesn't make you miserable.
