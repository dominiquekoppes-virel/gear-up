## Military vs. College: Your Decision Framework

### Consider Military First If You:
- [ ] **Want structure and clear direction** in your life
- [ ] **Like the idea of guaranteed job training** and employment
- [ ] **Are interested in travel** and seeing the world
- [ ] **Want to serve your country** and be part of something bigger
- [ ] **Need help paying for college** later (GI Bill benefits)
- [ ] **Thrive in team environments** and disciplined settings

### Consider College First If You:
- [ ] **Have a clear academic path** you're passionate about
- [ ] **Value personal freedom** and flexible schedules
- [ ] **Want to explore different interests** before committing to a career
- [ ] **Prefer civilian work environments**
- [ ] **Have family obligations** that make deployment difficult
- [ ] **Are uncomfortable with military authority structures**

**Remember:** These aren't mutually exclusive! Many people do both - military service first, then college with GI Bill benefits, or college with ROTC, then military service as an officer.

### Myth: "Military people aren't smart"
**Reality:** The military operates some of the most advanced technology in the world and requires intelligent, skilled people.

### Myth: "Once you join, you're stuck"
**Reality:** While there are commitments, there are also programs to help if you're not a good fit.
