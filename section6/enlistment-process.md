## The Enlistment Process: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Research and Self-Assessment
**Before talking to any recruiters:**

- [ ] **Research each branch** and their job opportunities
- [ ] **Talk to current/former service members** (not just recruiters)
- [ ] **Consider your goals** and how military service fits
- [ ] **Discuss with family** - this affects them too
- [ ] **Complete your research worksheet** (see below)

**Time needed:** Several weeks to do this properly

### Step 2: Talk to Recruiters
**Meeting with military recruiters:**

- [ ] **Visit recruiters from different branches** to compare options
- [ ] **Ask specific questions** about jobs, locations, deployment frequency
- [ ] **Don't sign anything** on your first visit
- [ ] **Get information in writing** - verbal promises don't count
- [ ] **Bring your list of questions** (see section below)

**Important:** Recruiters have quotas to meet. Be polite but remember they're trying to sell you on their branch.

### Step 3: Take the ASVAB
**The test that determines your options:**

- [ ] **Prepare for the test** with study materials
- [ ] **Take it seriously** - your score affects everything
- [ ] **You can retake it** if you're not happy with your score
- [ ] **Higher scores = better job choices** and potential bonuses

**Where to take it:** At a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) or sometimes at your school

### Step 4: MEPS (Military Entrance Processing Station)
**This is where everything becomes official**

**What happens at MEPS:**
- Complete comprehensive physical medical exam
- Finalize job selection and contract review
- Meet with career counselor
- Take oath of enlistment (if you choose to proceed)

**The physical exam includes:**
- Height and weight measurements
- Vision and hearing tests
- Blood and urine tests
- Joint and muscle movement tests
- Medical history review
- Discussion of any medical concerns

**Contract review:**
- Your exact job (Military Occupational Specialty)
- Length of service commitment
- Training location and timeline
- Benefits you'll receive
- Any bonuses or special programs

**Important:** MEPS typically takes 1-2 days. You'll stay overnight if needed (lodging provided free).

### Step 5: Delayed Entry Program (DEP)
**Time between enlisting and shipping to basic training**

**What this means:**
- You've committed but haven't left yet
- Usually 2-12 months depending on your job and branch
- Time to prepare physically and mentally
- Can still change your mind (with consequences)

**Use this time to:**
- Get in the best physical shape of your life
- Study your job field and military culture
- Spend time with family and friends
- Finish any personal business or goals
- Complete any additional requirements
