# [U] Collect Your Personal Information

**Get Your Paperwork Together (The Boring But Necessary Stuff)**

Take a few minutes to fill out this form. Then with your high school transcript in hand, you'll have everything you need to complete most college applications. You might need to work with your parent or family members to get all the details.

**Real Talk:** This stuff is tedious, but doing it once saves you from scrambling later when you're trying to meet deadlines.

When it comes time to apply, many universities charge a fee up to $100. However, universities often waive fees, with what is called a fee waiver or during College Knowledge Month (October). Ask your School Counselor or Get Ready Coordinator how to proceed.

**Money-Saving Tip:** If application fees are a concern, ask about fee waivers BEFORE you apply. Most schools will waive fees if you qualify - you just have to ask.

Leave areas blank if they don't apply to you.

**Don't have a lot of activities?** That's okay! Quality over quantity. Colleges would rather see you committed to a few things than scattered across many.

## Before You Submit Applications

**Double-check this stuff:**

- [ ] **Is your email address professional?** (hotguy2024@gmail.com is not going to impress admissions)
- [ ] **Are your phone numbers current?** (Colleges need to be able to reach you)
- [ ] **Did you spell everything correctly?** (Especially your name - it needs to match your transcript)
- [ ] **Do you have backup copies** of this information somewhere safe?
