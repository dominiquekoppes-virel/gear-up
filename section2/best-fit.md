# [U] What is the Best Fit for Me?

**Figure out what actually matters to you (not what you think should matter)**

Deciding which college to attend can be a challenge - there are so many factors to consider. What's important to you in a college experience? Take a look at your long-term goals and how college will help you get there. Visit college websites, take college tours, talk to current and former students, and read online reviews. In other words, learn as much as you can about potential college choices. You want to make sure that while the schools on your list have everything you want that you can see yourself actually attending and the atmosphere is right for you.

## Reality Check Questions

**After you've done your ranking, ask yourself:**

- [ ] **Am I being realistic about costs?** If affordability isn't in your top 3, double-check that you can actually afford your choices.

- [ ] **Am I overthinking location?** Sometimes students get stuck on wanting to be exactly 2.5 hours from home. Be flexible.

- [ ] **Am I picking schools for the right reasons?** Choosing a school because it sounds impressive to others usually doesn't lead to happiness.

- [ ] **What if my priorities change?** Will these schools still work if you discover new interests?
