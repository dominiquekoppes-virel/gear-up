# [U] Reach, Match, Safety Schools

**Building a smart college list (so you're not scrambling in April)**

When building your college list, you'll want to get the right mix of "reach schools," "match schools," and "safety schools." But what does that mean? And how many should you have of each? With the abundance of schools to choose from, dividing prospective colleges into these three categories - reach, safety, and match schools - can be helpful to examine how each school fits your academic and personal goals and narrow down your choices. In order to determine which category a particular school falls into, identify where your GPA and standardized test scores align with the various prospective programs. During this process, be honest about what you need out of a prospective school and how each school on your list would meet these requirements.

## Your College Strategy Breakdown

**Reach Schools:** A reach school is a college or university that you likely won't be accepted to, but it will be great if you did. Your GPA and standardized test scores fall at or below the school's published data on accepted students and/or the acceptance rate is less than 30 percent.

**Real Talk:** These are your "lottery ticket" schools. Apply to a couple if you want, but don't fall in love with them. Don't let a reach school rejection mess with your confidence.

**Match Schools:** A match school is a college that you're likely to be accepted to. Your GPA and standardized test scores fit all the requirements the college is looking for and the acceptance rate is around 30-60 percent.

**Why These Matter:** Match schools are where you'll probably end up, so spend time finding ones you actually like. Don't just apply because you think you can get in.

**Safety Schools:** A safety school is a college or university you're almost guaranteed to be accepted to if you apply. Your GPA and standardized test scores are at or above the school's published data on accepted students and the acceptance rate is 60 percent or higher.

**Important:** Your safety school should be somewhere you'd actually be okay attending. Don't apply to schools you'd hate just because you know you'll get in.

## How to Build Your List

You can start evaluating for academic fit by sorting your list into reach, match, and safety schools:

**For Reach Schools:**
Check off all of your requirement boxes. Your academic statistics, however, may fall a bit below the school's average numbers. If you find yourself within a reasonable range of the average statistics of an admitted student, then the school can fall under your reach schools column.

**For Match Schools:**
Admitted students at match schools have GPAs and test scores that are similar to yours. These schools offer you a good chance of acceptance and align closely with your academic, extracurricular, and budgetary interests. When selecting match schools, first identify your academic interests. Even if you aren't set on a major area of study yet, you likely have an idea of the subject you'd like to focus on. Research each school's offerings, narrowing down your list to a few that closely fit with your goals.

## What Combination Should You Choose?

**The Smart Strategy:**
While you likely want to try your chances at several reach schools, it's not a good idea to put all your eggs in this basket. While you may be tempted to apply to more than 10 schools, you want to curb this desire, too. Applications for colleges are lengthy and take up a lot of your time, especially if senior year. It's actually better to devote more time and effort to each of those applications, rather than applying to more and possibly not giving each the attention it needs. Understand which schools are reach, match, or safety for you is essential to be sure you're finding balance. Make sure you're comparing what the colleges are looking for from applicants, and how you stack up, before applying. A good rule of thumb to apply to 6-10 colleges. When you draft your final list, it should look something like this:

**Recommended Mix:**
- **2-3 Reach Schools**
- **3-4 Match Schools** 
- **2-3 Safety Schools**

**Why This Works:**
- You're covered if your reach schools don't work out
- You have real choices among schools where you'll likely get in
- You're not applying to 20+ schools and burning out on essays

## Reality Check Time

**Before you fall in love with any school:**

- [ ] **Can you actually afford it?** Even if you get in, can your family handle the cost?

- [ ] **What if you change your mind about your major?** Does this school have other options you'd be interested in?

- [ ] **Are you applying here for the right reasons?** Because you actually want to go there, or because it sounds impressive?

- [ ] **What's your backup plan?** If none of your four-year schools work out, what's Plan B?
