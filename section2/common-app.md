# [U] Common Application

**The one application that can save you a ton of time (if you use it right)**

Applying to college can be stressful and time consuming. Even though it is an exciting time, the steps required to apply to each college that you want to apply can sometimes be confusing and overwhelming. To help combat this the Common Application was created.

## What is the Common Application?

The Common Application, typically referred to as the "Common App," allows students to apply to many schools at once, using just one application form. The Common Application is a single online college application form used by over 900 colleges and universities. The Common App database also helps you track necessary application documents (like your letters of recommendation) and important deadlines.

**The Reality:** The Common App opens August 1st each year, but students can start the application any time and transfer information when the new version opens. To start the process, students simply visit CommonApp.org and click on the "Apply Now" button. The site will walk students through the process of creating an account and show them how to work on their application through the Common App platform. The site even offers tutorial videos to help students through the process.

**Bottom Line:** Using the Common App, students fill out information most colleges require like name, address, extracurricular activities lists, SAT/ACT test scores, and parent employment and education, and every school that accepts the Common App. Instead of filling it out a dozen times, you only have to do it once.

## When is the Common App Due?

**Your application deadline depends on whether you are applying early decision (typically November 1) or regular decision (typically January 1). Deadlines also vary by school, so be sure to check deadlines for every college you are applying to. You can find application deadlines (plus tons of school information) in our online college profiles.**

**Smart Move:** Start early. Don't wait until the last minute to figure out deadlines and requirements.

## What are the Common Application Essays?

**You'll submit one essay through the Common Application for all your schools. Though many schools require supplemental materials in addition to the Common App, the Common App covers most of the main parts of the application and also allows students to write one major essay to apply to multiple schools. Some colleges may ask you to also answer a few supplemental questions.**

**There are seven different Common App essay prompts from which students can choose to inspire their essay. No matter which prompt students choose, they should choose one that allows them to reveal new information that admissions officers will not learn from other parts of the application.**

**The Common App allows up to 650 words for the personal statement. Students should follow the essay and other applications as they would follow for scholarship applications or advice as they would follow for scholarship applications or other applications that use personal statements. Check out the essay prompts so you can start to strategize about which essay to write:**

## Common App Costs

**The platform is free to use, but every college charges their own application processing fee (usually $30 to $75). If you have concerns about paying for your college applications, you can get a "fee waiver" just like a regular college application.**

**Money-Saving Tip:** Fee waivers can save you hundreds of dollars if you're applying to multiple schools. Ask your counselor about getting them.

## What Colleges Can You Apply to with the Common App?

**The Common Application is used by nearly 900 schools, including schools that are non-U.S. based. Common App colleges are a varied list of institutions: private, public, big, small, engineering colleges and liberal arts schools. Check out the full list of schools at:**

**or either browse the list of colleges on the Common App, or to search for a specific school.**

## Do I Have To Use The Common App To Apply To College?

**No, you do not need to use the Common App. It may be more convenient to do so, as long as the school(s) you're applying to accept applications through their own website, you will not need to use the Common App. Some schools will require that you use their application and exist as an option on the Common Application, anyway. While some schools require you to apply through the Common App. Make sure to read the instructions on your prospective school's website before applying.**
