# [U] Testing Decisions & Options

**Figure out your ACT/SAT strategy (and when test-optional might help)**

## Should I Take or Retake College Entrance Exams?

**The ACT and SAT are college admissions tests. Many colleges and programs use ACT or SAT scores in their admission decisions, although some do not. Universities specifically require one test over the other. Universities often use ACT / SAT scores to place students in specific courses, particularly for math. Additionally, universities use these tests to determine merit-based scholarships. The higher the score, the more free money you earn!**

### I Already Took the ACT or SAT as a Junior. Should I Re-take It My Senior Year?

**Once you've received your test score(s) report, take a moment to congratulate yourself for completing a three-hour exam in an accomplishment in itself. Next, realize that sometimes students need to take the ACT or SAT two or three times to maximize their score. This is completely normal; in fact, most students take these exams more than once. Some students take both tests to see which one they do better on, then re-take only the one exam they did better on to see if they could improve that score.**

**Here's how to decide whether you should re-take one or the other:**

### What Scores Do I Need for My Target Universities and Scholarships?

**Take a moment to research the schools you want to attend. Many schools list the average or mid-range SAT and ACT scores for their admitted students on their website (check the Admissions section). Aim to be at or above their posted average score, but keep in mind that extracurriculars and GPA also factor into the admission decision. Use the 'scholarship estimator' tools on college websites to figure out whether a higher score could earn you a bigger scholarship. If so, how likely is it you could improve your score?**

### Are My Score Expectations Realistic?

**With effort, increasing your ACT score by 3 or 4 points on your second attempt is realistic. For the SAT, well-prepared students can see a 40-point increase on the retake. So, look at where you are and what the college expects to determine if a retake makes sense. Also, the higher your score, the harder it is to raise it with future retakes. For example, if you scored a 34 on a retake, it's unlikely it will improve on a third attempt. Again, preparation between retakes is key.**

### How Many Times Have You Already Taken Each Test?

**Although retaking the test can raise your score, after the third attempt, it's unlikely to raise your score unless your preparation is drastically different. Go ahead and retake, but change the way you prepare between exams.**

### How Do I Move Forward?

**If you've considered these questions and come to the conclusion that you don't want or need to retake either test, congratulations! Focus on completing your applications and essays, and on making a strong finish in your high school career. If you decide to retake the ACT or SAT, then pick a test date that fits your schedule and deadlines and start using the prep tools available.**

**Some are free and others are not. Ask your School Counselor for test prep resources at your school.**

### Test Fee Waivers

**The costs associated with applying to tests can get expensive. If you can't afford college admission test fees, you may be able to get them eliminated. All you need to do is ask for a "fee waiver." You must ask for and apply for a test fee waiver through your high school counselor. You can receive up to four waivers for SAT tests and two for the ACT.**

**Important:** When you qualify for an ACT or SAT test fee waiver, you will become eligible for college application fee waivers as well.

## Test Optional Admissions

**The COVID-19 pandemic prevented high school students from gathering in person to take the ACT or SAT. This led to many colleges to change their admissions process to test-optional, meaning students did not have to submit ACT or SAT scores to have their applications considered. Even though in-person standardized testing has resumed, many schools have kept their test-optional policies. This page provides information and resources around test optional college applications.**

### Different Kinds of Test Admissions

**Test Optional:** This is a term for schools that don't require students to submit test scores before admissions decisions are made. This means that students have the power to choose whether ACT/SAT scores will be considered in the admissions process.

**If you are applying to test-optional schools, however, it's likely that your scores or your choice not to submit them will still factor into your admission decision. You can think of optional test scores like any other optional or supplemental part of a college application - a supplemental letter of recommendation or an optional essay prompt. You don't have to do them, but they're additional opportunities to showcase your value and uniqueness as a candidate, so of course you should take advantage of them! In doing so, you paint yourself as an applicant who will go above and beyond to stand out to admissions officers. If two applicants have similarly strong essays, extracurriculars, letters of recommendation, and GPAs, the candidate who includes test scores will very likely be favored.**

**Test Free or Test Blind:** Schools that are test-blind will not consider an applicant's test scores even if they are submitted. Admissions decisions are made solely on the basis of GPA, letters of recommendation, extracurriculars, research projects, supplemental essays, etc. Even if you have a perfect ACT or SAT score, it will not give you any advantage at test-blind schools. If you are applying to test-blind schools, submitting your scores or not won't change your chances of admission.

### Should I Submit My Scores?

**There are a couple of situations where not including test scores is the right decision for you. First, if you can't afford to take the tests or cannot afford the coaching needed to achieve the scores you want to present to colleges. Second, if you struggled with test-taking and even after lots of practice and multiple tries you don't think your scores represent you or your academic abilities, you might want to leave them out.**
