## Post-Acceptance Checklist

**Take care of these tasks in the months before starting college:**

### Financial & Administrative

□ **Pay or Defer your enrollment deposit**
   
   The enrollment deposit confirms your acceptance and begins the process of signing up for an orientation. If you're eligible for a Pell Grant and other circumstances, you can request a deferment, which means you would pay the deposit later. Contact your college to ask about deferment.

□ **Review financial aid offers and accept/decline awards. Check if you were selected for FAFSA verification.**
   
   Check for important financial aid status on your student account email. You may need to submit additional paperwork for scholarships or your Pell Grant. This step is crucial to ensure you receive funding for school, and deadlines are strict. (See [Section 3: Financial Aid](../../section3/) for more info on FAFSA verification.)

### Academic Preparation

□ **Take placement tests**
   
   Many colleges will require you to take placement tests before registering for courses. You may need to schedule an in-person appointment at your college to take the tests, or you may receive an email with instructions on how to take the tests online. Either way, brush up on your math and English basics to prepare.

□ **Participate in an orientation**
   
   Review the orientation dates and options and select the earliest possible date that works with your schedule.

□ **Send your final high school transcript (after high school graduation)**
   
   Most colleges will require you to submit your final high school transcript after graduation. Since many high school campuses are closed or have irregular hours during the summer, it's important to contact your school office, registrar, or counseling office BEFORE the last day of school to request them to send your final transcript to your college. Write down the name and contact information for the person from your school who can answer transcript questions over the summer just in case you need it.
   
   **Contact person at my high school:**
   **Name:** _______________________________________________
   **Email:** ______________________________________________  
   **Phone:** _____________________________________________
   **Office hours:** _______________________________________

### Housing & Campus Life

□ **Apply for housing**
   
   If you will live on-campus, review your housing options and apply/select the residence hall where you would like to live. This may require you to pay a housing deposit.

□ **Register for courses**
   
   Class registration varies from college to college. At some colleges, students meet with advisors during orientation to register for classes. Other colleges may require online registration. Either way, check your student email and account to get the details, and don't hesitate to make an appointment with an advisor if you have questions.

□ **Submit your immunization records**
   
   If you're required to submit immunization records, you can either scan and upload them on your university website or ask your high school to include immunization records on your official high school transcript.

□ **Check the mail and email for invitations to summer bridge programs at your college**
   
   Summer bridge programs can give you a jump-start on adjusting to college. They can help get you up to speed on academic subjects before college, and you get the opportunity to meet other students. Ask about these programs and sign up!

**You may complete more steps than the ones listed. Just remember – ask questions if you have any doubts and check your email regularly, so you don't miss any important reminders or deadlines.**

# Application Tracking

**Stay organized so nothing falls through the cracks**

As you begin the college application process, apply to a variety of colleges, including a safe choice, match choice, and a reach. Get the scoop on each type on the previous pages.

**Safety:** Your academic credentials fall above the school's range for the average freshman. It's safe to anticipate acceptance.

**Match:** Your academic credentials fall within (or even exceed) the school's range for the average freshman. There are no guarantees, but it's reasonable to expect acceptance.

**Reach:** Your academic credentials fall below admission guidelines, but it's important to reach for the stars. Go for it, and apply to that selective dream school.
