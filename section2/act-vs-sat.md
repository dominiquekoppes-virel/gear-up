**ACT:**
1. English: 45 mins, 75 questions
2. Math: 60 mins, 60 questions  
3. Reading: 35 mins, 40 questions
4. Science: 35 mins, 40 questions

2. Writing and Language: 35 mins, 44 questions
3. Math: 80 mins, 58 questions
4. Essay (optional): 50 mins, 1 essay

### Tools

**ACT:** You can use a calculator on all math questions.

**SAT:** Some math questions don't allow you to use a calculator.

### Essay

**ACT:** Optional. Essay assesses your writing skills and your ability to compare and contrast different perspectives. For the essay, you will read a short passage about an issue and then analyze the different perspectives on this issue. You'll be asked to give your own opinion on the issue.

**SAT:** Optional. Essay assesses your writing skills and your reading comprehension skills. For the essay, you will read a short passage about an issue. Your essay will analyze the author's argument using evidence and reasoning. In other words, you will not be giving your own opinion.

### Score

**ACT:** Total score range: 1 – 36. Each section uses a scale of 1 – 36. Your total score is the average of your four section scores. The optional Writing section uses a scale of 2 – 12 and does not count toward your final score.

**SAT:** Total score range: 400 – 1600. The Evidence – Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) and Math sections each use a scale of 200 – 800 and are combined for a total score. The optional Essay uses three separate scales of 2 – 8 and does not count toward your final score.

### Accommodations

**Both tests:** English Learners and students with documented disabilities can request accommodations. Students with disabilities can request accommodations.

## Which Test Should You Take?

**The honest answer:** Most students do about the same on both tests relative to other test-takers. Some do better on one than the other, so consider taking both once to see.

**Generally:**
- **Take the ACT if:** You prefer faster-paced questions, like having a calculator for all math, and are comfortable with science reasoning
- **Take the SAT if:** You prefer having more time per question, are strong in vocabulary, and don't mind some no-calculator math

**Important:** Check which test your target colleges prefer (though most accept either).

## What are College Placement Tests?

**After you accept admission to a college, you may need to take placement tests in subjects like math and english to ensure you're placed in the appropriate-level courses.**

### Who Uses Placement Tests?

**Almost all two-year colleges and many public four-year colleges require new students to take at least one placement test before registering for classes. Some private four-year colleges also use these tests.**

### What Are Placement Tests Like?

**Colleges use several common placement tests. The tests usually measure skills in these subjects:**
- Math
- Reading  
- Writing

**Some placement tests are given online, and you receive scores as soon as you finish. Several states and individual colleges have developed their own placement tests.**

### How Can I Prepare?

**Placement tests measure the skills you've already learned in high school, so your preparation should include reviewing sample questions to learn what topics to brush up on. To get ready for these tests, you can:**

- **First, check with an admission officer at your college to find out if you must take a placement test.**

- **If so, find out what subjects the test will cover.**

- **Check the college website for information about the test and ways to prepare.**

### What Do The Results Mean?

**Your test results may mean that you can skip some introductory courses, or they can show that you need more preparation before taking on college-level work.**

**If you need more preparation, a college may require you to take a remedial course.**

### What Are Remedial Classes?

**Remedial classes help improve your skills in a subject to prepare you for the rigor of college level math and English. Don't get discouraged if you end up in classes like this. These classes will show your strengths and weaknesses, so you'll know where to focus. They also increase your likelihood of academic success.**

### What Happens After I Take The Test?

**Once your test results are available, you may be assigned automatically to the course level that fits you best, or you may meet with your academic advisor to choose your courses.**
