# [T] Community College Transfer Options

**The smart money move: Start at community college, transfer to university**

If you plan to attend a community college first and then transfer to a four-year university, it's important to learn about specific transfer programs and requirements. These programs, and resources, help you keep on the right track and make sure your community college courses transfer to and count toward your degree at your university of choice.

**Why this matters:** Not all courses transfer to all schools. Planning ahead saves you time, money, and frustration.

## MnTC (Minnesota Transfer Curriculum)

**The Minnesota Transfer Curriculum (MnTC) is a collaborative effort among all Minnesota two and four-year public colleges and universities to help students easily transfer their general education. When you complete the MnTC, you will have fulfilled all lower-division general education requirements at any Minnesota public university. The MnTC requires that students must:**

• **Complete all 10 goal areas**
• **Earn at least 40 credits**  
• **Earn a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 or better** (though D grades may be used toward requirements)

### MNTC GOAL AREAS

**Goal 1:** Communication
**Goal 2:** Critical Thinking  
**Goal 3:** Natural Science
**Goal 4:** Math/Logical Reasoning
**Goal 5:** History & Social & Behavioral Sciences
**Goal 6:** Humanities & Fine Arts
**Goal 7:** Human Diversity
**Goal 8:** Global Diversity  
**Goal 9:** Ethical & Civic Responsibility
**Goal 10:** People & the Environment

**Once all of these requirements are met, the MnTC notation is automatically applied to your transcript and you meet the requirements for the Associate of Arts in Liberal Education.**

**Bottom Line:** Complete the MnTC and your general education requirements transfer as a package to any Minnesota public university.
