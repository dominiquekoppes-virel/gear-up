# [U] Personal Information (Continued)

**Almost done with the paperwork pile!**

## Honors & Awards

**Don't stress if this section feels light - not everyone has a trophy case.**

| **Award Name & Date** | **Reason for Award/Honor** | **Sponsor** |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**What counts as an honor or award?**
- Academic awards (honor roll, subject-specific awards)
- Athletic achievements (MVP, team captain, league recognition)
- Community recognition (volunteer awards, citizenship awards)
- Work-related recognition (employee of the month, leadership roles)
- Creative achievements (art shows, writing contests, music competitions)

**Don't have many awards?** That's totally normal. Focus on the experiences and growth, not the hardware.

## Community Service

**Quality over quantity - colleges want to see genuine engagement, not just hours.**

| **Organization** | **Description of Service** | **Dates** | **Hours** | **What You Learned/Impact** | **Contact Info** |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|------------------|
| | | | | | |

**Community Service Ideas (if you need to get started):**
- Local food bank or soup kitchen
- Animal shelter or rescue organization
- Tutoring younger students
- Helping elderly neighbors with yard work or technology
- Environmental cleanup projects
- Religious or cultural organization volunteer work
- Coaching youth sports or activities

**Real Talk:** Authentic service that connects to your interests is better than random volunteer hours. If you love animals, volunteer at a shelter. If you're good at math, tutor kids.
