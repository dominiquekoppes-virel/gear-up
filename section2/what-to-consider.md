# [U] What Should You Consider When Making a List?

**Time to get practical about what you actually want.**

When considering schools, you want schools that fit what you want academically, socially and culturally. Think about what you want your life to be like in college. As you start building your initial list and get a feel for what you do want in a college, consider the following factors:

## Location
Location plays a major role in your college experience. The state, the size of the city, and the local community, all impact your time at school. A university in a busy city might offer you more internship opportunities while a school in a smaller town might have a large campus and offer more on campus activities and opportunities. As you consider college locations, think about what you will gain and lose.

**Reality Check:** That college in California might look amazing on Instagram, but are you ready for the cost of flights home? And no, you probably won't visit as much as you think you will.

## Major
Are you interested in studying Psychology? Have you always been curious about medicine? Make sure the schools you're interested in offer the academic programs and degrees you're considering pursuing. If you are unsure of what you want to study? Check out the courses and majors offered at schools you're thinking of applying to so you get a feel of the kinds of programs that typically exist at most colleges.

**The Truth:** Most people change majors anyway, so don't stress if you're not sure. But do make sure the schools you're looking at have options in areas that interest you.

## Student/School Size
Pay attention to the size and culture of the school. Smaller colleges have smaller class sizes, more access to professors, a close-knit community, and more availability to resources such as housing, transportation, etc. Larger colleges tend to have more sports funding, more things happening on and around campus, and a wider variety of classes and options for majors.

## Extracurriculars & Athletics
Are you looking for certain sports programs, clubs, or student organizations? Keep an eye out for any extracurricular programs that are important to you.

## Other Things to Consider:

**The Money Stuff:**
• **Tuition and fees** (the big scary number)
• **Housing availability and cost** (dorms vs. apartments)
• **Transportation availability and cost** (can you get around without a car?)

**The Practical Stuff:**
• **Length, time and location of classes**
• **Percentage of students who return the following year** (if lots of people transfer out, that's a red flag)
• **School facilities and equipment**
• **School or program reputation**
• **Support services** (meals, counseling, job placement)
• **Tutoring and academic support services**
• **Campus safety**
• **Faculty experience and expertise**

## What Success Looks Like

**Once you've thought about what you want in a potential college, take a look at indicators of student success at the colleges you're interested in:**

### Average Salary After Graduation
A college degree is in most cases a gateway to better career opportunities. It's important to research what kind of career outcomes the average student at each college you're interested in achieves. After all, that could be you if you end up attending!

**Real Talk:** Look up actual numbers, not just what the glossy brochures say. Websites like CollegeScorecard.ed.gov have real data about what graduates actually earn.

### Graduation Rates
This is the percentage of students that successfully obtain a Bachelor's degree after 4-6 years at any given college. Graduation rates lower than 70-80% are a red flag - they can indicate that students at that college are struggling or dropping out more frequently.

**Why This Matters:** If a lot of students don't finish, there might be reasons - like poor support, financial issues, or the school just not setting students up for success.

## Your Research Checklist

**For each school you're seriously considering:**

□ **Tuition per year:** $__________
□ **Room & board per year:** $__________
□ **Total estimated cost:** $__________
□ **Graduation rate:** _________%
□ **Average debt at graduation:** $__________
□ **Job placement rate:** _________%
□ **Average starting salary for my major:** $__________

**Questions to ask yourself:**
□ Can I actually afford this (with financial aid)?
□ Will I be happy spending 4+ years here?
□ Does this school help students like me succeed?
□ What happens if I change my mind about my major?
