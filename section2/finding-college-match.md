# [U] Finding Your College Match

**You're thinking about college? Cool. Let's make sense of this.**

College is a major investment - and may be one of the largest expenses you'll face in your lifetime. So it's important to do your research and find an institution and program that best fits with your personal and professional goals.

**But here's the thing:** There are literally thousands of colleges out there. You don't need to research them all - you need to find the ones that actually make sense for you.

## Different Kinds of Schools

**PUBLIC TWO-YEAR COLLEGES**
These institutions accept all students with a high school diploma or GED and offer a variety of educational options. You can earn a credential focusing on a specific occupation, or you can take up to the first two years of courses to complete a bachelor's degree upon transfer to a four-year university. Additionally, many colleges offer opportunities to participate in athletics, clubs, activities, and music or the arts.

**PUBLIC FOUR-YEAR UNIVERSITIES**
Minnesota State and the University of Minnesota offer a wide variety of undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs. Most offer a wide range of athletics and intramural sports as well as programs in theater, music and the arts. Undergraduate on-campus housing is also available on most campuses.

**PRIVATE FOR-PROFIT CAREER COLLEGES**
They offer programs focusing on specific careers. Some colleges focus on one specific career, such as cosmetology schools, while others offer several career programs. Programs generally range from a few months to two years.

**PRIVATE FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES**
Most of private universities in Minnesota are liberal arts colleges, which emphasize broad knowledge in the arts, sciences, social sciences and humanities. Many are affiliated with a religious denomination. Some colleges only focus on students wishing to receive a bachelor's degree, while others only offer graduate training or a combination of both.

## What Are You Looking For in a School?

**Before you start browsing college websites and comparing different schools, take a step back.**

Decide what you're looking for in a school. Ask your parents to do the same thing. Then compare your answers and come to some agreement as to what you want in a school.

**Think about these questions:**

□ **Why do I want to go to college?**

□ **What do I want to get out of college?**

□ **How will college help me work toward my goals?**

□ **Which college will best/least help me work toward my goals?**

□ **What are the advantages/disadvantages of going now rather than later?**

□ **Does it matter how many students are enrolled with me?**

□ **Do I want to be with students who have diverse ideas, viewpoints and backgrounds?**

□ **In which type of campus setting am I most/least comfortable?**

**Reality Check:** Don't eliminate a school solely because it's outside your comfort zone. The challenge of dealing with the unfamiliar can help you grow as a person.

**Your College Brainstorm**

**What I think I want to study (it's okay if you're not sure):**
