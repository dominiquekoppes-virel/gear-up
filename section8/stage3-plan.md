## Special Pathway Considerations

### Graduate Degrees:
Some careers require advanced degrees such as a master's or doctorate (for example, lawyer, doctor, psychologist). Companies may pay higher salaries to those with advanced degrees regardless of whether it's necessary for the job. **Important:** You must complete a bachelor's degree before working toward a master's or doctorate.

### Military Service:
If you plan to serve in the military, explore all different paths: military academy, ROTC officer training, and direct enlistment. Each program and branch varies greatly, so research is key. Military service can provide job training, education benefits, and leadership experience.

### Transfer Programs (2+2, 3+1):
You may ultimately want to earn a bachelor's degree but start at a community college first. In this case, you'll complete 1-3 years at community college and then transfer to a university. This can save significant money while providing the same degree.

### Licensing and Certification:
Some careers require licenses to practice (cosmetologists, electricians, therapists, nurses, teachers). You'll complete the education, pass an exam, and pay a fee. Typically, you'll renew the license through ongoing professional development.
