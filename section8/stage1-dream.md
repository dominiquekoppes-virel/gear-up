# Stage 1: Dream - Envision Your Ideal Life

**Before thinking about careers, think about the life you want to live.**

Most people start career planning by asking "What job do I want?" But that's backwards. The better question is "What kind of life do I want?" Once you understand that, you can figure out what work might help you create that life.

**This stage is about dreaming big and getting honest about what matters to you.**

## Why Start With Life Vision?

### Work Is Just One Part of Life
Your job will significantly impact:
- How you spend most of your waking hours
- Where you live and how much you earn
- Your stress levels and free time
- Your sense of purpose and fulfillment

But work isn't everything. You also want to consider:
- Relationships and family
- Hobbies and personal interests
- Health and lifestyle choices
- Community involvement
- Personal growth and learning

### Your Values Drive Everything
Understanding what you value most helps you make decisions that lead to satisfaction rather than regret. Different people value different things, and that's okay.

**Examples of different values:**
- **Security vs. Adventure:** Some people want predictable routines, others crave variety
- **Independence vs. Collaboration:** Some thrive working alone, others need team environments
- **Work-Life Balance vs. Career Ambition:** Some prioritize family time, others love intensive careers
- **Stability vs. Growth:** Some want steady environments, others need constant challenges

## Consider These Life Questions

### Work-Life Balance:
- What kind of lifestyle do you want?
- How do you want to spend your time outside of work?
- How important is having flexibility in your schedule?
- Do you want work that you can "leave at the office" or something you're passionate about 24/7?

### Personal Fulfillment:
- How might you use your interests and talents in an ideal job?
- What could you do to make the world a better place?
- How important is it that your work feels meaningful?
- What would make you excited to get up on Monday morning?

### Practical Considerations:
- How much money do you realistically need/want?
- Are you willing to move for opportunities or do you want to stay local?
- How do the desires and needs of your family factor into your future happiness?
- What lifestyle expenses matter to you (travel, hobbies, family support, etc.)?

## Dream Big About Your Future

### Think About Your Work Style Preferences:

**People Interaction:**
- Would you prefer to engage with people in your everyday work life, or do you prefer to work alone as much as possible?
- Do you enjoy helping others solve problems?
- Are you energized or drained by lots of social interaction?

**Work Environment:**
- Would you prefer to work inside or outdoors?
- Do you like structured environments or flexible, changing situations?
- Do you prefer physical activity or mental challenges?
- Would you rather work with your hands or with ideas?

**Lifestyle Factors:**
- **Income:** Is a high salary important? Think about how expensive your hobbies and pastimes are, how many family members you expect to support, and other lifestyle considerations.
- **Travel:** Do you like to travel, even if that means being away from loved ones? Or do you prefer staying close to home?
- **Purpose:** How important is it that your work is meaningful? Is it important to "make a difference" in the world/your community?
- **Security:** Do you want predictable income and benefits, or are you willing to take risks for potentially higher rewards?

## Family and Cultural Considerations

**Consider these questions honestly:**

### Family Influences:
- Is it important to you to take over a family business/farm, follow in your parent's footsteps, or pursue a career that your parents want for you?
- Do you want to forge your own path regardless of family opinions?
- Are you and your family's desires aligned, or do you have different visions?
- How important is it to stay geographically close to family?

### Cultural and Community Factors:
- What careers are respected in your community?
- Are there cultural expectations you want to honor or challenge?
- How important is it to give back to your community?
- Do you want to be a role model for others with your background?

### Financial Family Considerations:
- Will you need to help support family members financially?
- Do you have siblings whose education might also need funding?
- Are there family debts or obligations to consider?
- What financial safety net does your family provide?

## Food for Thought

*"Worry less about what you want to be, and think more about what you want to do. The question to ask yourself is not 'What can I get?' The question that will propel you the furthest and offer the most meaningful and satisfying course of action is 'What can I give?'"*
â€” President Barack Obama, February 10, 2016
