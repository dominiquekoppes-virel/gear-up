# I'm Uncertain About Plans After High School

**A Decision-Making Guide for Finding Your Path**

If you're feeling uncertain about what comes next after high school, you're not alone. Most students have doubts, and that's completely normal. Being unsure doesn't mean you're behind or failing - it means you're being thoughtful about a big decision.

**Reality Check:** You don't have to have it all figured out right now. Most people change careers multiple times, and there's no single "right" path. The goal is to make a good next step, not to plan your entire life.

---

## Why It's Okay to Be Uncertain

### You're In Good Company
- **Most high school seniors** feel uncertain about their future
- **Adults change careers** 5-7 times on average
- **Many successful people** didn't know what they wanted to do at 18
- **College students** change majors frequently (it's expected!)

### Uncertainty Can Be Smart
Being unsure might mean:
- You're considering your options carefully
- You're aware there are many possibilities
- You're not rushing into something that might not fit
- You're realistic about what you don't know yet

**Pro Tip:** Uncertainty is different from indecision. Uncertainty means you're gathering information. Indecision means you're stuck. This guide helps you move from uncertainty to informed decision-making.
