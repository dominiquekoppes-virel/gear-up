# Understanding Your Student Aid Report (SAR)

**What happens after you submit your FAFSA**

After you submit your FAFSA, you'll receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) within a few days. Think of this as your financial aid "report card" - it tells you what the government thinks your family can afford and whether you're eligible for federal aid.

**Don't panic if the numbers seem wrong at first.** The SAR is complex, but understanding it helps you plan for college costs and catch any errors early.

---

## What is the SAR?

**The Student Aid Report summarizes:**
- The information you submitted on your FAFSA
- Your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) or Student Aid Index (SAI)
- Your eligibility for federal financial aid
- Any issues with your application that need to be resolved

**Key Point:** The SAR doesn't tell you exactly how much aid you'll get from each school - that comes later in award letters. It just tells you what you're eligible for federally.

---

## How and When You'll Get Your SAR

**Timeline:**
- **3-5 days** after submitting FAFSA online
- **2-3 weeks** if you submitted a paper FAFSA (don't do this unless absolutely necessary)

**How you'll receive it:**
- **Email link** if you provided an email address on FAFSA
- **Paper copy** mailed to your address if no email provided
- **Online access** through your FSA ID at fafsa.gov

**Pro Tip:** Even if you get an email, log into fafsa.gov with your FSA ID to view your complete SAR. The email version might not show everything.

## Understanding Your EFC/SAI Number

**Expected Family Contribution (EFC) or Student Aid Index (SAI):**
This is the key number the government calculates based on your family's financial information.

**What it means:**
- Government's estimate of what your family can afford to pay for one year of college
- Used by schools to determine your financial need
- Lower number = more financial aid eligibility

**What it does NOT mean:**
- What you will actually pay (schools set their own prices)
- What your parents are required to pay
- The amount of aid you'll definitely receive

**Example EFC/SAI ranges:**
- **$0-$1,000:** Maximum Pell Grant eligibility
- **$1,001-$6,000:** Partial Pell Grant eligibility  
- **$6,001+:** No Pell Grant, but may qualify for other aid

## Common SAR Issues and Solutions

**What to do:** Contact your school's financial aid office immediately
**Documents you might need:** Tax transcripts, W-2s, bank statements, verification worksheets

### "My EFC seems too high"

- Wrong number of family members in college
**What to do:** Review your FAFSA for errors and make corrections if needed

### "My EFC is $0 but I still don't qualify for aid"

## Using Your SAR Information

### For College Planning
**Use your EFC to estimate costs:**
- **College cost:** $20,000
- **Your EFC:** $5,000  
- **Estimated need:** $15,000
- *Schools will try to meet some/all of this need with aid*

### For Comparing Schools
**Calculate your potential out-of-pocket costs:**
- Look up each school's total cost of attendance
- Subtract your estimated Pell Grant
- Subtract other likely aid (research school's average packages)
- Remaining amount = what you might need to pay/borrow

### For Family Discussions
**Use SAR to have realistic money conversations:**
- "The government thinks we can afford $X per year"
- "This means we should look at schools costing $Y or less"
- "We need to plan for $Z in additional costs"
