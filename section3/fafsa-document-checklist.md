# FAFSA Document Checklist

**Get your paperwork together before you start**

The FAFSA asks for specific financial information about you and your family. Having these documents ready before you start will make the process much smoother and faster. Don't try to wing it - gather everything first.

**Time-Saving Tip:** Collect all these documents, then sit down with your parent (if you're dependent) to complete the FAFSA together. Having everything in one place prevents multiple trips back and forth.
