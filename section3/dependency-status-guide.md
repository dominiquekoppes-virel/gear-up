# Dependency Status Guide

**Who counts as your "parent" for FAFSA? It's more complicated than you think.**

One of the most confusing parts of FAFSA is figuring out whose financial information you need to include. The government has very specific rules about who counts as "dependent" vs. "independent," and it's probably not what you think.

**Important:** You can't just decide to be independent because you pay your own bills or don't live with your parents. The federal government has strict rules that determine your status.

---

## Are You Independent or Dependent?

**You are INDEPENDENT (don't need parent info) if ANY of these apply:**

- [ ] **You will be 24 or older** by December 31st of the school year
- [ ] **You are married** (or separated but not divorced)
- [ ] **You will be working toward a master's or doctorate degree**
- [ ] **You currently have children** who receive more than half their support from you
- [ ] **You have dependents** (other than children or spouse) who live with you and receive more than half their support from you
- [ ] **You are currently serving on active duty** in the U.S. Armed Forces for purposes other than training
- [ ] **You are a veteran** of the U.S. Armed Forces
- [ ] **Since you turned age 13, both your parents were deceased,** you were in foster care, or you were a ward of the court
- [ ] **You are currently or were an emancipated minor** as determined by a court
- [ ] **You are currently or were in legal guardianship** as determined by a court
- [ ] **You are an unaccompanied homeless youth** or at risk of being homeless

**If NONE of these apply to you, you are DEPENDENT** and must provide parent information.

## If You're Dependent: Whose Information Do You Need?

**This is where it gets complicated. The rules are based on your living situation, not who you feel closest to.**

### If Your Parents Are Married to Each Other
**Simple:** Include both parents' information on the FAFSA.

### If Your Parents Are Divorced or Separated
**More complicated:** Include information for the parent you lived with most during the past 12 months.

- **If you lived with one parent more:** Use that parent's information
- **If it was exactly 50/50:** Use the parent who provided more financial support
- **If you don't live with either parent:** Use the parent who provided more financial support in the past 12 months

### If Your Custodial Parent Has Remarried
**Include your step-parent's information too.** 
- Your step-parent counts as your parent for FAFSA purposes
- You need their tax returns and financial information
- This is true even if they don't contribute to your college costs

### Special Situations

**What if the parent I need to include won't help?**
- Unfortunately, you still need their information to get most federal aid
- Talk to a financial aid counselor about your options
- Consider dependency overrides (very rare and require extensive documentation)

**What if I don't know where my non-custodial parent is?**
- You only need information from your custodial parent
- If your custodial parent remarried, include step-parent information

**What if my parents never married?**
- Use the parent you lived with most in the past 12 months
- Same rules as divorced parents apply

---

## Parent Information Decision Tree

**Start here:** Are your parents married to each other?

**YES** → Include both parents' information

**NO** → Go to next question

---

**Did you live with one parent more than the other in the past 12 months?**

**YES** → Use that parent's information

**NO (50/50 split)** → Go to next question

---

**Which parent provided more financial support in the past 12 months?**

Use that parent's information

---

**Has your custodial parent remarried?**

**YES** → Include step-parent information too

**NO** → Just use custodial parent information

---

## Who Does NOT Count as Your Parent

**These people are NOT your parents for FAFSA purposes, even if they raised you:**

- **Grandparents** (unless they legally adopted you)
- **Step-parent** (if not married to your custodial parent)
- **Older siblings**
- **Legal guardians** (unless you're still in legal guardianship)
- **Foster parents**
- **Aunts or uncles**
- **Anyone else** who took care of you but didn't legally adopt you

**If none of your legal parents are available,** you may qualify for a dependency override. This requires documentation and approval from your school's financial aid office.

---

## Dependency Override: The Exception

**In very rare cases, you might qualify for a dependency override even if you don't meet the independent criteria.**

**Possible reasons:**
- Abusive family situation
- Abandonment by parents
- Incarcerated parents with no support
- Parents with severe mental health or substance abuse issues preventing them from providing support

**What you need:**
- Extensive documentation from third parties (counselors, social workers, clergy, etc.)
- Written statements explaining your situation
- Approval from your school's financial aid office
- Different schools may make different decisions

**Important:** Dependency overrides are rare and require compelling circumstances. Simply not getting along with your parents or them refusing to pay for college doesn't qualify.

## Common Misconceptions

**"I'm financially independent, so I don't need parent info"**
- **Wrong.** Being financially independent doesn't make you independent for FAFSA

**"My parents won't help pay for college, so I shouldn't include them"**
- **Still need their info.** FAFSA determines what you're eligible for, not what parents will actually pay

**"I can just choose which parent's information to use"**
- **Nope.** Specific rules determine which parent's information you must use

**"My step-parent doesn't count because they're not my 'real' parent"**
- **They count.** If they're married to your custodial parent, you must include their information

---

## Tips for Complicated Family Situations

**If gathering parent information is difficult:**

- [ ] **Start early** - give yourself time to work through complications
- [ ] **Be patient** with family members who might be hesitant to share financial information
- [ ] **Explain the importance** - help them understand this affects your ability to get financial aid
- [ ] **Get help** - school counselors and financial aid offices deal with these situations regularly
- [ ] **Consider timing** - if parents are recently divorced, you might need to wait for new tax returns

**If you're not sure which parent to include:**
- Contact your school's financial aid office
- Better to ask than to guess wrong and delay your aid

## Dependency Status Worksheet

**Use this to determine what information you need:**

### Step 1: Check Your Independence Status

- [ ] I am married
- [ ] I am working toward a graduate degree
- [ ] I have children I support
- [ ] I have other dependents I support

- [ ] I am/was an emancipated minor
- [ ] I am/was in legal guardianship
- [ ] I am homeless or at risk of homelessness

**If you checked ANY box:** You're independent - no parent info needed

**If you checked NO boxes:** You're dependent - continue below

### Step 2: Determine Which Parent Information You Need

**My parents' current status:**
- [ ] Married to each other
- [ ] Divorced
- [ ] Separated  
- [ ] Never married
- [ ] One or both deceased

**Parent I lived with most in past 12 months:**
- [ ] Mother
- [ ] Father  
- [ ] 50/50 split

**If 50/50 split, parent who provided more support:**
- [ ] Mother

**Has custodial parent remarried?**

## When You're Still Confused

**Contact these people for help:**

- **Your school counselor** - familiar with these situations
- **Financial aid office** at colleges you're considering
- **Federal Student Aid** - 1-800-4-FED-AID
- **Your GEAR UP coordinator**

**Remember:** Financial aid offices deal with complicated family situations every day. Don't be embarrassed to ask for help figuring out whose information you need.

**Bottom Line:** The dependency rules might seem unfair or illogical, but they're federal law. Work within the system to get the aid you're eligible for, and remember that this is just one step in funding your education.
