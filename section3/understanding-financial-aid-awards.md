# Understanding Financial Aid Awards

**Making sense of your aid offers (and what they really mean for your wallet)**

Congratulations! You've been accepted to college and received your financial aid award letters. But before you celebrate, you need to understand what these letters actually mean. Not all financial aid is created equal, and the school with the biggest aid package might not actually be the most affordable option.

**Reality Check:** Award letters can be confusing and sometimes misleading. Take time to understand exactly what you're being offered before making decisions.

## Types of Financial Aid in Your Award

### Free Money (The Good Stuff)
**You don't have to pay this back:**

**Grants:**
- Federal Pell Grant (up to $7,395/year)
- State grants (Minnesota State Grant, etc.)
- Institutional grants (from the college itself)
- Usually based on financial need

**Scholarships:**
- Merit-based (academic, athletic, talent)
- Need-based scholarships
- Outside scholarships you won
- Often renewable with certain requirements

### Earned Money
**You work for this:**

**Work-Study:**
- Part-time job while in school
- Federal program - usually on campus
- You earn money as you work (not guaranteed income)
- Typical awards: $1,500-$4,000 per year

### Money You Borrow (Be Careful)
**This has to be paid back with interest:**

**Federal Direct Loans:**
- **Subsidized loans:** Government pays interest while you're in school
- **Unsubsidized loans:** Interest starts accumulating immediately
- **Parent PLUS loans:** Parents borrow for your education

**Private Loans:**
- From banks or other lenders
- Usually higher interest rates than federal loans
- Less flexible repayment options

## Reading Your Award Letter

### Key Information to Look For

**Total Cost of Attendance (COA):**
- Tuition and fees
- Room and board
- Books and supplies
- Personal expenses
- Transportation

**Expected Family Contribution (EFC):**
- What the government thinks your family can pay
- Based on your FAFSA information

**Financial Need:**
- COA minus EFC = Your demonstrated financial need
- Schools try to meet some or all of this need

**Types of Aid Offered:**
- Grants and scholarships (free money)

## Calculating Your Real Cost

### What You Actually Need to Pay

**Net Cost Calculation:**
1. **Start with Total Cost of Attendance**
2. **Subtract grants and scholarships** (free money)
3. **Subtract outside scholarships** you've won
4. **This equals your net cost**

**Don't automatically subtract:**
- Work-study (you have to work to earn this)
- Loans (these add to your debt)

### Example: Comparing Two Schools

**School A:**
- Total Cost: $25,000
- Grants/Scholarships: $15,000
- **Net Cost: $10,000**

**School B:**
- Total Cost: $35,000
- Grants/Scholarships: $20,000
- **Net Cost: $15,000**

*School A is actually $5,000 cheaper per year, even though School B offered more total aid.*

## Red Flags in Award Letters

### Watch Out For:
- [ ] **Loans labeled as "aid"** without clearly identifying them as loans
- [ ] **Work-study counted as guaranteed income** (you have to work to earn it)
- [ ] **One-year only awards** presented as if they're renewable
- [ ] **Required fees** not included in cost estimates
- [ ] **Private loans** automatically included without your consent

### Questions to Ask Schools:
- "Which parts of this aid package are grants vs. loans?"
- "Is this aid renewable for all four years?"
- "What GPA do I need to maintain to keep my scholarships?"
- "Are there additional fees not shown here?"
- "What happens if my family's financial situation changes?"

## Making Your Final Decision

### Financial Decision Framework

**Calculate 4-year costs:**

- Add estimated loan interest
- Consider potential cost increases

**Consider earning potential:**
- Research average salaries in your intended field
- Calculate reasonable debt-to-income ratio
- Don't borrow more than your expected first-year salary

**Think about alternatives:**
- Community college for first 2 years
- In-state public universities
- Schools where you qualify for merit aid
- Gap year to work and save money

### Questions to Ask Yourself:
- Can I realistically afford this debt after graduation?
- Will this school help me reach my career goals?
- Are there less expensive options that would work just as well?
- What if I change my major or don't graduate on time?

## Getting Help

**If you need help understanding your awards:**

- **Financial aid office** at each school
- **Your high school counselor** or GEAR UP coordinator

- **College planning professionals** (many offer free consultations)

**Red flags for help services:**

## Your Financial Aid Decision

**Remember:**
- **The cheapest option** isn't always the best, but it might be the smartest
- **Debt follows you** long after graduation
- **You can succeed** at many different schools
- **Financial fit** is as important as academic fit

**Final reality check:**
- Will I be able to make loan payments after graduation?
- Am I choosing this school for the right reasons?
- Do I have a backup plan if things don't work out?

**Bottom line:** Choose the school that gives you the best education you can afford, not necessarily the one with the biggest aid package or the most prestigious name.

## Quick Reference

**Net cost** = Total cost - grants/scholarships (free money only)
**Good debt-to-income ratio:** Total student loans ≤ first year expected salary
**Annual requirements:** FAFSA, academic progress, enrollment
**Appeal deadlines:** Usually 30-60 days after award letter
**Decision deadline:** Often May 1st for fall enrollment

**Most important question:** Can I afford the debt this will create?
