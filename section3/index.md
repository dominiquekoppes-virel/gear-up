# Section 3: Financial Aid

**The money talk nobody wants to have (but you need to)**

Let's be real: college costs money. Sometimes a lot of money. But here's the thing - there's actually help available if you know how to find it and ask for it. Financial aid isn't just for "poor" students or academic superstars. Two out of every three college students get some type of financial assistance.

**This section will help you:**
- Understand what financial aid actually is (and isn't)
- Navigate the FAFSA without losing your mind
- Figure out what you might qualify for
- Make sense of all the paperwork
- Plan realistically for college costs
