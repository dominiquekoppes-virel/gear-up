# FSA ID Setup Worksheet

**Your digital signature for all things financial aid**

Before you can complete the FAFSA, you AND your parent (if you're dependent) need to create FSA IDs. This is basically your username and password for all federal student aid websites. Treat this information like your Social Security number - keep it safe and don't share it.

**Why you need this:** Your FSA ID serves as your legal signature on the FAFSA and other federal student aid documents.

## Pre-Setup Checklist

- [ ] **Somewhere safe to write down your login information**

**Important:** Use an email you check regularly and will have access to for years. This isn't the time for your funny email address - keep it professional.
