# Understanding Financial Aid

**The money talk nobody wants to have (but you need to)**

Let's be real: college costs money. Sometimes a lot of money. But here's the thing - there's actually help available if you know how to find it and ask for it. Financial aid isn't just for "poor" students or academic superstars. Two out of every three college students get some type of financial assistance.

**This section will help you:**
- Understand what financial aid actually is (and isn't)
- Navigate the FAFSA without losing your mind
- Figure out what you might qualify for
- Make sense of all the paperwork
- Plan realistically for college costs

## Financial Aid Reality Check

**What financial aid CAN do:**
- Significantly reduce college costs
- Make education accessible to more families
- Provide work experience through work-study
- Help you graduate with manageable debt

**What financial aid CAN'T do:**
- Pay for everything (you'll likely still have costs)
- Guarantee you'll get into expensive schools
- Replace the need for careful financial planning
- Fix bad financial decisions

**Important Numbers to Remember:**
- **Average debt at graduation:** $37,000 (don't let this be you)
- **Maximum Pell Grant:** $7,395/year (most families get less)
- **Community college average cost:** $3,800/year
- **4-year public university average:** $15,000+/year

## Before You Dive In

**Get your mind right about money:**

- [ ] **It's okay to talk about your family's finances** - financial aid requires honesty about income
- [ ] **Every family's situation is different** - don't compare your aid to others
- [ ] **Free money exists** - but you have to look for it and apply
- [ ] **Loans are serious** - only borrow what you can realistically pay back
- [ ] **Questions are welcome** - financial aid officers are there to help, not judge

**Quick Reality Check Questions:**
- Can my family help pay for college? How much?
- What can I realistically afford to borrow?
- Am I looking at schools I can actually afford?
- Have I researched all my options (not just the expensive ones)?
