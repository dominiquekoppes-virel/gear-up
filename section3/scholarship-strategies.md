# Scholarship Search and Application Strategies

**Free money is out there - you just have to go get it**

Scholarships are basically free money for college that you don't have to pay back. But here's the reality: they don't just fall into your lap. Finding and winning scholarships takes effort, strategy, and persistence. The good news? There are scholarships for almost everything - academics, athletics, hobbies, background, intended major, and even random things like being left-handed.

**Truth bomb:** Most scholarships are small ($500-$2,000), but those add up. Don't ignore the small ones while chasing the big ones.
