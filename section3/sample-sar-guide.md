## Key SAR Sections Explained

### Expected Family Contribution (EFC)
**In this example: 000000**

**What this means:**
- Your family's expected contribution is $0
- You qualify for maximum Pell Grant
- You have the highest level of financial need
- Schools will try to meet your need with aid packages

### Federal Student Aid Eligibility
**Based on your EFC, the SAR shows:**

**Pell Grant Eligibility:**
✓ "Based on your EFC it appears that you may be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant of up to $6495, provided you have not met or exceeded the lifetime limit of Pell Grant eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant program. You may also be eligible for other grants, work-study opportunities, and low-interest student loans."

**Other Federal Aid:**
✓ "We sent your information to other federal agencies to verify your eligibility for federal student aid and there appears to be an issue with the information provided on your application. Review the checklist on page 3 for instructions on how to resolve these issues."

### Verification Selection
**Common notice on SARs:**
*"Being selected for verification is quite common. Check your email and student account at your college to get more information on how to complete the verification process at your college."*

**What you need to do:**
- Contact your school's financial aid office
- Provide required documentation
- Complete verification worksheets
- Submit by deadlines to avoid aid delays

## Understanding SAR Comments and Codes

### Comment Codes You Might See
**C = Comment** - Check for additional information needed
**H = Hold** - Issue that needs resolution
**R = Reject** - Application cannot be processed as submitted

### Common SAR Comments
- **"Pell Grants are based on family income"** - Lower income = higher Pell Grant
- **"The lower the income or Estimated Family Contribution (EFC), Student Aid Index (SAI), the more money you will receive"**
- **Verification requirements** - Additional documentation needed
