# Questions and Answers about Paying for College

**Financial aid options for undocumented students**

If you're a high school student who's undocumented—that is, you were born outside the United States and you're not a U.S. citizen or legal resident—you probably have a lot of questions about going to college. This section provides answers and resources to help you navigate the financial aid process.

## Federal Financial Aid

### Can I get federal financial aid?
**No.** You can't get federal financial aid unless you're a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen. This means you should not fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) unless it's required for a scholarship application.

### Can I get a Pell Grant?
**No.** Pell Grants are a type of federal financial aid, so they're not available to undocumented students.

### Can I get financial aid from my state?
**Yes, if you qualify for the DREAM Act,** you can receive both in-state tuition rates and state financial aid. Learn more in our [Minnesota DREAM Act Guide](../mn-dream-act/).

## College Financial Aid and Scholarships

### Do colleges offer financial aid or scholarships to undocumented students?
**Yes, some do.** Here's what's available:

**Private colleges** often have special funds available for undocumented students. Many private institutions have more flexibility in their aid policies.

**Public colleges and universities** provide privately funded financial aid available through the DREAM Act application. Some also award scholarships to students regardless of immigration status.

**What to check:** Some universities may ask you to complete the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE instead of a FAFSA. Contact the admission or financial aid office at each college you're interested in to find out their specific requirements.

### Am I eligible for scholarships?
**Yes,** you just need to find ones that you qualify for. Here's where to start:

- **Talk to your Guidance Counselor** about scholarships available for undocumented students
- **Search our [Scholarship Resources](../scholarship-resources/)** for comprehensive lists
- **Look into local scholarships** offered by community groups that might be open to all students living in the local community
- **Apply to private scholarship organizations** - many allow undocumented students to apply
- **Find scholarships specifically for undocumented students** - they do exist!

## In-State Tuition and Residency

### Do I pay the in-state or out-of-state rate at a public college in my home state? What about in a different state?

**Since policies from college to college differ,** you'll want to contact each institution to find out what you qualify for. In some cases, private colleges and out-of-state colleges make better offers, so it's important to carefully review all your financial aid awards.

**Minnesota law and college policies are constantly changing.** For up-to-date information on the status of tuition rates for DACA and undocumented students, contact the college's financial aid or residency offices.

### Minnesota DREAM Act Eligibility
Many public colleges and universities in Minnesota charge in-state tuition to undocumented students if they qualify for the DREAM Act. 

**To qualify, students must meet the following requirements:**

1. **Attended a Minnesota high school for at least 3 years; and**

2. **Graduated from a Minnesota high school or earned a GED in Minnesota; and**

3. **Males ages 18-25 years old** must register with the U.S. Selective Service

**Important clarifications:**
- **The MN Dream Act does NOT require DACA** or any other lawfully present or legal status
- **"Non-immigrant aliens"** (individuals here on student VISAs, work VISAs, or visitor VISAs) have different requirements

Learn more about eligibility and benefits in our [Minnesota DREAM Act Guide](../mn-dream-act/).

## FAFSA and Documentation

### The FAFSA process can look very different for DACAmented students, citizen students with undocumented parents, and undocumented students.

#### DACAmented Students
**DACAmented students are NOT eligible for federal aid.** However, some colleges may request DACAmented students to complete the FAFSA to determine college aid and private scholarships.

**If a college asks you to complete the FAFSA:**
- You can use your Social Security Number to create an FSA ID
- Complete the FAFSA online
- Select "No, I am not a US Citizen or eligible non-citizen"
- You will receive a rejection notice from FAFSA, but this won't affect your Estimated Family Contribution (EFC)
- The college will use the EFC to determine how much private aid they award you

**If your parents don't have Social Security Numbers:** You'll need to fill out the paper version of the FAFSA.

#### Citizen Students with Undocumented Parents
If you are a U.S. citizen and your parent is undocumented:
- You must manually enter income information on the FAFSA application
- Don't use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool
- Since undocumented parents don't have SSNs, they can't create an FSA ID
- They can print, sign, and mail the signature page
- The barcode on the signature page will match your application

#### Undocumented Students
**If you don't have a SSN, you can't submit the FAFSA.** However, you have other options:

- **Apply for the Minnesota DREAM Act** (also called the Prosperity Act) for in-state tuition rates, MN state aid, and private scholarship aid at public institutions
- **Complete the CSS Profile** if requested by colleges - this can show financial need for institutional aid
- **Apply directly for private scholarships** that don't require FAFSA completion

---

## Alternative Financial Aid Applications

### Minnesota DREAM Act Application
For students who can't complete the FAFSA, the Minnesota DREAM Act provides:
- In-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities
- Access to state financial aid programs
- Eligibility for privately funded scholarships
- Work-study opportunities (if you have work authorization)

### CSS Profile
Some colleges use the CSS Profile to award their own institutional aid:
- Available to students regardless of citizenship status
- Shows your family's financial need to colleges
- Required by some private colleges for their aid programs
- Has a fee, but fee waivers are available
