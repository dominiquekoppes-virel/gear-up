## Understanding Your Situation

### Important Terms to Know

**DREAMers:** Individuals who would have qualified under the DREAM Act and are often referred to as DREAMers. The term has been used to refer to individuals in the U.S. who were brought to the country at an early age without documentation but have assimilated to the U.S. culture and have been educated by U.S. school systems. At this time, this term does not define a documentation status, but instead, it is used to define an identity or a community. Some people do not use the term DREAMer because it separates young undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children from other immigrants, creating more marginalization.

**Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program:** A kind of administrative relief from deportation. The policy allows youth under 31 years old as of June 15, 2012, who came to the United States before the age of 16 without documentation, and have been educated by U.S. school systems, the opportunity to remain in the U.S. by following specific guidelines. The DACA program has undergone changes since it was created. For up-to-date information on DACA, visit uscis.gov and search the site for "DACA."

**DACAmented:** A term used to indicate the documentation status of a person who applied and received relief from deportation through DACA.

## Four Essential Things You Need to Know

### 1. You CAN Go to College

The first thing you should know is that **no federal law prevents U.S. colleges from admitting undocumented students.** And only a few states have placed any kind of restrictions on undocumented students attending public colleges and universities. 

**In Minnesota, all students can attend public colleges and universities.** In most cases, colleges set their own rules for processing students and determining residency status, so you should research the policies of the colleges you are interested in attending. 

**Important:** Undocumented students cannot receive federal financial aid for college—the type of aid on which many college students rely. However, undocumented students can get financial aid or scholarships for college in other ways. This is covered in our [Paying for College Q&A](../paying-for-college/) section.

### 2. You Are Not Alone

**You're the one who will have to put in the work it takes to get to college**—but building a support network is key. Start with your family. Make sure they know you want to go to college. Talk with them about your options for choosing a college and paying for your education.

You can also seek advice from trusted staff at your high school. Along with giving you guidance, they might be able to put you in touch with other undocumented students who have enrolled in college or with college admission counselors who can help you.

**If you're worried about telling teachers and counselors that you're undocumented, be aware that, by law, school officials cannot disclose personal information about students—including their immigration status.**

### 3. You Can Find a College That Fits You

As you look for colleges that match your wants and needs, find out if the colleges you're interested in have programs, student organizations, or centers that support first-generation immigrant students. 

**Reviewing college websites and publications is a good place to start.** Look for:
- Support programs for undocumented students
- First-generation college student resources
- Diversity and inclusion centers
- Student organizations for immigrant communities
- Financial aid policies for undocumented students

### 4. Resources Are Available to Help You

This section of the guide will provide you with general information on paying for college, filling the FAFSA as a DACA recipient, or completing the DREAM Act application to attend school in Minnesota.

**Additional resources include:**
- College access programs specifically for undocumented students
- Scholarship opportunities for undocumented students
- Legal resources and immigration assistance
