## Where to Start Your Search

**Most scholarship opportunities can be found online using search engines based on a personal profile you complete on the site.**

### Start Local, Think Big
**Thousands of scholarships exist, from local to national, given by individuals to large companies.** 

**Local Scholarships** (Your best bet):
- Less competition
- Smaller amounts but easier to win
- High school counseling office
- Local businesses (banks, hospitals, car dealers)
- Service clubs (Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions Club)
- Community foundations
- Religious organizations
- Labor unions (if parents are members)

**State and Regional:**
- Minnesota-specific scholarships
- Regional foundations
- State professional organizations

**National Scholarships:**
- Get a lot of attention because they often offer large awards
- Very competitive
- Still worth applying, but don't put all your hopes here

**Pro Tip:** Did you know you could be eligible for a scholarship simply based on the high school you attend, or even the town where you live? Start locally and expand your search outward. All awards add up, so apply for all the scholarships you can.

### How to Protect Yourself:
- **If you're unsure about a certain company or opportunity, check with your School Counselor**
