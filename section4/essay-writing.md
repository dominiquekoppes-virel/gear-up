# Scholarship Essay Writing Guide

**How to write essays that actually win scholarships**

Many college and scholarship applications require an essay or personal statement. The personal statement can be one of the most stressful parts of the application process because it's the most open-ended. Even the terminology can be confusing if you aren't familiar with it.

**Here are some basic terms:**

**Personal statement** — An essay you write to show who you are and why you deserve to be admitted or receive money

**College essay** — An essay that is basically the same as a personal statement but it responds to a prompt that is a question or statement

## Understanding What They Want

### Common Essay Prompts

**From the 2022-2023 Common App and scholarship applications:**

- **"Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, please share your story."**

- **"Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?"**

- **"If the essay is about you, give a brief description of your experiences, aspirations, family background, etc. Touch on why you want the scholarship."**

**The following tips can help you write a stand-out essay:**

## Writing Strategy: Highlight the Memorable

### Choose Your Topic Wisely

- [ ] **Pick a topic you're passionate about** - This will help show what makes you unique

- [ ] **Don't focus on the great aspects of a particular college** - The amount of dedication it takes to be a doctor, or the number of extracurricular activities you took part in during high school

- [ ] **Share your personal story and thoughts** - Take a creative approach and highlight areas not covered in other parts of the application, like your high school records

- [ ] **Don't cover too many topics** - This will make the essay sound like a resume that doesn't provide any insight into your personality

- [ ] **Focus on one aspect of yourself** so the readers can learn more about who you are - Remember, readers must identify your main idea and follow it from beginning to end

## Essay Structure Guide

### Introduction (First Paragraph)
**Tip:** Provide an overview of what you are going to talk about in the essay; be sure it is answering the essay prompt. The introduction has to reveal to the reader what your essay is about and catch their attention.

**Hook Examples:**
- Start with a specific moment or scene
- Use an interesting quote or question
- Begin with an unexpected fact about yourself
- Open with dialogue that sets the scene

### Body (Paragraphs 2-3)
**Tip:** Go into more detail on one of the topics listed in paragraph 1. For example, elaborate on your previous experiences, family financial situation, volunteer work, employment, academic career, future goals, college plans, etc. If you want your essay to be credible, you need to make sure everything you write supports that viewpoint. Don't simply state a fact, also include specific details and examples to develop your ideas. You can do that by offering examples from your personal experiences and writing about what truly motivates you and how you developed a certain belief.

**What to Include:**
- Specific examples and details
- Personal experiences that shaped you
- Challenges you've overcome
- Goals and aspirations
- How this scholarship connects to your plans

### Conclusion (Last Paragraph)
**Tip:** Close your essay with a wrap-up of why you're the best candidate for the scholarship; how your goals match those of the organization. Avoid stating, "In conclusion..." and don't regurgitate what you wrote in earlier paragraphs. All scholarships differ, so you will craft your essay specific to the requirement and expectations of the organization offering the award. Closely consider the question/prompt on the application and research the organization, so you can tailor your essay. Most important? Be yourself. Essays offer a view of who you are and how you view the world.

## Writing Tips That Work

### Use Your Own Voice

**Don't use jargon like:**
- "There is so much suffering in the world and I feel I have to help people." 
- Avoid overly formal or business-like language
- Don't use unnecessary words

**Do write in your own voice:**
- Write about a real experience that made you feel you had to take action
- Remember, there may be 1,000s of applicants, but there is only one you! 
- Talk about what is important to you and not what you think the admissions committee wants to hear

**Don't plagiarize** - Admissions officers will be able to tell

---

## Show, Don't Tell

### Paint a Picture with Words

**Instead of saying:** "I'm a hard worker"  
**Write about:** The specifics of working 20 hours a week while maintaining honor roll

**Instead of saying:** "I want to help people"  
**Write about:** The moment you realized you wanted to pursue nursing after volunteering at a local hospital

**Instead of saying:** "I'm a leader"  
**Write about:** How you organized a food drive that collected 500 cans for the local food bank

### Use Specific Details

**Include:**
- Exact numbers and facts
- Sensory details (what you saw, heard, felt)
- Names of people, places, organizations
- Specific moments in time
- Dialogue when appropriate

**For example, if you write about surrounding yourself with diversity, what does that look like? Who do you speak to, and how do they respond? What's the takeaway?**

**Keep multiple versions:**
- 250-word version (short answer)
