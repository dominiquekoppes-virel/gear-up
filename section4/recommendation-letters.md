# Letters of Recommendation Guide

**Getting people to vouch for you (and making it easy for them to say yes)**

Many applications, from scholarships to jobs, require recommendations from people who know you. A recommendation letter is from a previous teacher, professor, or employer describing you and your skills to a prospective program or employer. The purpose of the recommendation letter is to give people a chance to understand you on a more personal level. Applications can look the same from person to person, so letters of recommendations help you stand out by highlighting your personality and what you uniquely bring.

**You choose who to ask, so think about those teachers, counselors, coaches, supervisors, or other adults who know you well in an academic or personal setting, and ask them to write a reference letter for you.**

## Who Should You Ask?

### Best Choices for Recommendations:

**Teachers:**
- Subject area teachers who know your work well
- Teachers in subjects related to your intended major
- Teachers who've seen you grow over time
- Teachers who can speak to your work ethic and character

**School Personnel:**
- Guidance counselors (know your overall academic record)
- Coaches (can speak to teamwork and dedication)
- Activity advisors (know your leadership and involvement)
- Principals or administrators (if you've worked with them)

**Community Adults:**
- Employers or supervisors
- Volunteer coordinators
- Religious or community leaders
- Mentors or family friends who know you professionally

**Consider someone who can discuss your:**
- Personal character, strengths, and challenges
- Academic abilities and potential
- Leadership and teamwork skills
- Growth and development over time

## How to Ask for a Recommendation

### Timing Is Everything

**Always ask at least 2-4 weeks ahead of time** if they're able to recommend you. You do not want to miss an application deadline because the person was too busy to complete the recommendation process (such as answering surveys or writing a letter of recommendation). Ask them at least two weeks' in advance (three to four is even better).

### The Right Way to Ask

**In person or by phone first:**
- "Would you be willing to write a strong letter of recommendation for me?"
- Give them an easy way to say no if they're too busy
- Ask if they feel they know you well enough to write a positive letter

**Follow up with details:**
- Purpose of the recommendation
- Deadline for submission
- How to submit (online, mail, email)
- Any specific requirements or forms

### What Information to Provide

**Make it easy for them by providing:**

- [ ] **The recommendation request form** (see our [Recommendation Request Form](../recommendation-form/))
- [ ] **Information about the scholarship/program** you're applying for
- [ ] **Your resume or list of activities** and achievements
- [ ] **Your personal statement or essay** (if you've written one)
- [ ] **Specific deadline and submission instructions**
- [ ] **Addressed envelope** if they need to mail it

**Provide the individual(s) with the necessary instructions, forms, addresses, and/or stamped, addressed envelopes.**

## Making the Process Smooth

### Follow These Tips:

**Give them what they need:**
- All forms and instructions clearly organized
- Your contact information in case they have questions
- Deadline reminders (but don't be annoying)

**Follow up appropriately:**
- Send a polite reminder one week before the deadline
- Don't ask if they've completed it multiple times
- Check if they need any additional information

**Show appreciation:**
- Write a thank-you note to anyone who recommends you
- Let them know the outcome of your application
- Recommendations take time, and people put a lot of thought and effort into them - don't take them for granted

## What Makes a Strong Recommendation

### What Recommenders Should Include:

**Specific Examples:**
- Particular projects or assignments you excelled in
- Times you showed leadership or helped others
- Challenges you overcame or growth you demonstrated
- Your character in action, not just general statements

**Academic/Professional Qualities:**
- Work ethic and reliability
- Intellectual curiosity and potential
- Communication and interpersonal skills
- Problem-solving abilities

**Personal Characteristics:**
- Integrity and character
- Resilience and determination
- Teamwork and collaboration
- Leadership potential

### Help Them Help You

**Provide context about:**

- What aspects of your character or abilities you'd like highlighted
- Specific experiences you've shared with them that were meaningful
- Your future goals and how this opportunity fits

---

## Multiple Recommendations Strategy

### When You Need Several Letters:

**Select different perspectives:**
- Academic teacher (shows scholarly ability)
- Coach or activity advisor (shows character and teamwork)
- Employer or volunteer supervisor (shows work ethic)
- Community leader (shows civic engagement)

**If you need more than one person to serve as a reference for the same application, select individuals familiar with different aspects of your life** (e.g., one teacher, your supervisor at work, and your soccer coach).

- Choose recommenders who seem enthusiastic about helping you

### If You're Running Short on Time:
- Be honest about the timeline when asking
- Offer to provide extra information to make their job easier
- Consider asking someone who knows you very well and can write quickly
