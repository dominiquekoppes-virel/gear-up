## A-C

### ACT/SAT
**What they are:** Standardized college entrance exams. Many colleges and universities require ACT or SAT scores as part of the application process.

**What this means for you:** These tests can affect college admissions and scholarship opportunities. Higher scores = more options. But many schools are now "test-optional," meaning you can choose whether to submit scores.

**Reality Check:** Don't stress too much about these tests. They're just one part of your application, and you can usually retake them if needed.

### Admission
**What it is:** Notification from the college to which you applied that you are accepted. Students must respond by the given deadline to inform the college if they will accept the offer.

**What this means for you:** Getting admitted doesn't automatically mean you're going - you still need to decide if you can afford it and if it's the right fit. Students accepted at multiple schools will want to compare their financial aid packages to help them decide which school to attend.

**Pro Tip:** Getting into college is just the first step. Make sure you can actually afford to attend before getting too excited.

### Advanced Placement (AP)
**What it is:** College-level courses offered at high school in which students have the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced college course placement, or both.

**What this means for you:** AP classes can save you time and money in college by letting you skip introductory courses. But they're not required for college admission.

**Reality Check:** AP classes are great if you're genuinely interested in the subject, but don't overload yourself just to impress colleges.

### Advisor
**What they are:** A college staff member or professor who helps a student plan and complete a course of study at a college or university.

**What this means for you:** Your advisor becomes your guide through college requirements and course planning. Build a good relationship with them - they can help you avoid mistakes and find opportunities.

**Pro Tip:** Meet with your advisor regularly, not just when you're in trouble. They can help you stay on track and discover opportunities you didn't know about.

### Apprenticeship
**What it is:** Registered apprenticeships provide the opportunity to "earn while you learn." Partnerships between trade organizations, employers, state government, and community colleges provide a program that combines classroom training (which may include college credit course) and paid, supervised on-the-job training, lasting 2-5 years.

**What this means for you:** You get paid to learn valuable skills instead of paying for school. After completion, you're eligible for certificates of completion and/or licenses for specific occupations and trades.

**Why it's awesome:** No student debt, guaranteed job training, and good pay. It's a smart alternative to traditional college for many careers.

### Application
**What it is:** A form that must be filled out to be considered for entry into university, community college, or technical school. Scholarships and job openings may also require applications.

**What this means for you:** Applications are your chance to tell schools or employers why they should choose you. Take them seriously and give yourself plenty of time.

**Pro Tip:** Start applications early and have someone proofread them before submitting. Small mistakes can hurt your chances.

### Associate Degree
**What it is:** A degree granted after successful completion of a course of study requiring approximately 60 credits, typically by a community or junior college (also known as AA or AS degree, short for Associate of Arts and Associate of Science).

**What this means for you:** It's a stepping stone that can lead directly to work or transfer to a 4-year university. It takes about 2 years and costs much less than starting at a university.

**Smart move:** Many successful people start with associate degrees and transfer to universities later.

### ASVAB
**What it is:** A test to determine qualification for enlistment in the U.S. Armed Forces. It stands for Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery.

**What this means for you:** If you're considering military service, your ASVAB score determines what jobs you qualify for. Higher scores = more job options and potential bonuses.

**Reality Check:** You can retake the ASVAB if your score isn't what you want, so prepare well and don't stress if you need a second try.

### Award Letter
**What it is:** Notice from a school of the amount and type of financial aid that the school can provide a student.

**What this means for you:** This tells you exactly how much the school will help you pay for college. Compare award letters from different schools carefully - the school with the biggest aid package isn't always the cheapest option.

**Important:** Make sure you understand which parts are grants (free money) versus loans (money you have to pay back).

### Bachelor's Degree
**What it is:** A degree earned for a course of study that normally requires 120 to 130 credits, involving specific classes related to the student's major. Full-time students ideally complete a bachelor's degree in four years, though changing majors, transferring institutions, taking fewer than 15 credit hours per semester, and/or taking courses that don't count toward one's declared major can extend the time commitment.

**What this means for you:** This is what most people mean when they say "college degree." It opens doors to many careers and is required for graduate school.

**Reality Check:** Also known as BA or BS, short for Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science. Don't worry too much about the difference - it usually doesn't matter to employers.

### Certificate
**What it is:** An official document that attests to a particular accomplishment. In the postsecondary world, these certifications may require a series of courses, internships, and tests before a student can work in that field.

**What this means for you:** Certificates are faster and cheaper than degrees but still provide valuable job skills. Examples include welding, medical technology, auto mechanics, massage therapy, and court stenography.

**Good to know:** Many certificate programs take less than a year and lead directly to employment.

### CLEP
**What it is:** The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) is a group of standardized tests created and administered by the College Board. These tests assess college-level knowledge in 36 subject areas and provide a mechanism for earning college credits without taking college courses.

**What this means for you:** If you're good at a subject, you might be able to "test out" of required college classes, saving time and money.

**Pro Tip:** Check if your target schools accept CLEP credits before spending time studying for these exams.

### Community College
**What it is:** A public postsecondary institution that offers courses to residents in the surrounding area. Students may attend community colleges to obtain associate degrees or technical certificates, or may take courses there towards a bachelor's degree before transferring to a four-year university (2+2 or 3+1 pathway).

**What this means for you:** Community colleges are often your best value for education. Students can also take courses to enhance their skills in an area or just for fun.

**Why it's smart:** Much cheaper than universities, smaller classes, more flexible scheduling, and excellent transfer options.

### Cost of Attendance (COA)
**What it is:** The total cost of going to college, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, transportation, and personal expenses.

**What this means for you:** This is the real cost of college, not just tuition. Always look at the total COA when comparing schools.

**Reality Check:** The "sticker price" can be scary, but most students pay less than the full COA thanks to financial aid.

### Course of Study
**What it is:** Group of courses students are required to take in order to earn a college degree; a major.

**What this means for you:** This is basically your major - the main subject you're studying. You'll take some courses in your major and some general education courses.

**Don't stress:** Most students change their major at least once, so you don't have to have it all figured out from day one.

### Credit or Credit Hour
**What it is:** Points awarded for successful completion of high school or college courses. College credit hours usually equal the number of hours a class meets per week.

**What this means for you:** Credits are how colleges measure your progress toward graduation. You need a certain number to graduate (usually around 60 for associate degree, 120 for bachelor's).

**Good to know:** Full-time students typically take 12-15 credit hours per semester.

## D-F

### Deferment
**What it is:** A period in which payment is not required. In the postsecondary realm, students can obtain deferment on paying their enrollment deposit as well as on paying interest and/or principal on student loans.

**What this means for you:** You can sometimes delay payments if you're having financial trouble. Deferments do not last forever - eventually, these payments must be made.

**Important:** Interest might still accumulate during deferment, so understand the terms before agreeing.

### Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program
**What it is:** A kind of administrative relief from deportation. The policy allows young children (under the age of 16) who came to the U.S. without documentation and have been educated by U.S. school systems, the opportunity to remain in the U.S. by following specific guidelines.

**What this means for you:** DACA recipients can work legally and attend college but aren't eligible for federal financial aid. However, they may qualify for state aid and private scholarships.

**Important:** DACA policies can change, so stay informed about current requirements and benefits.

### Degree
**What it is:** Academic credential given by colleges or universities to students who have completed a course of study.

**What this means for you:** Degrees show employers that you have specific knowledge and can complete long-term commitments. Different levels include associate (2 years), bachelor's (4 years), master's (additional 1-3 years), and doctoral (additional 3-7 years).

**Reality Check:** More education usually means higher earnings, but also more time and money invested upfront.

### Doctoral Degree
**What it is:** The most advanced academic degree, awarded after three to five years of additional study following completion of a master's degree.

**What this means for you:** This is the highest level of education, typically required for careers like college professor, researcher, or some types of psychologists.

**Reality Check:** Only pursue a doctoral degree if your career absolutely requires it - it's a huge time and financial commitment.

### DREAM Act
**What it is:** Individuals who would have qualified under the DREAM Act are often referred to as DREAMers. The term has been used to refer to individuals in the U.S. who were brought to the country at an early age without documentation, but have assimilated to the U.S. culture and have been educated by U.S. school systems.

**What this means for you:** In Minnesota, qualifying students can get in-state tuition and financial aid regardless of immigration status through the Minnesota DREAM Act.

**Good to know:** Not all immigrant youth identify as DREAMers - some prefer other terms.

### Dual Enrollment
**What it is:** A student in high school is also taking courses from an institution of higher learning, such as a community college or university. The college classes the student takes typically count toward their high school diploma as well as college credit.

**What this means for you:** You can get a head start on college while still in high school, often for free or at reduced cost.

**Pro Tip:** This is a great way to explore college-level work and potentially graduate college faster.

### Early Action
**What it is:** When a student applies for admission to a college by an early deadline (before the regular admission deadline) and receives notice of acceptance, denial, or deferment with no obligation to the university to enroll.

**What this means for you:** You find out sooner if you're accepted, but you're not committed to attending. This can reduce stress during senior year.

**Smart strategy:** Apply early action to schools you're seriously considering, but don't feel pressured to apply everywhere early.

### Early Decision
**What it is:** When a student applies for admission to a college by an early deadline (before the regular admission deadline), with the understanding that if accepted, the student must enroll in that school.

**What this means for you:** This is a binding commitment - if you're accepted, you must attend and withdraw applications from other schools. Students should apply for early decision only to their first-choice school.

**Warning:** Only use early decision if you're 100% sure about the school and can afford it without comparing financial aid packages.

### Expected Family Contribution (EFC)
**What it is:** The portion of a family's financial resources that should be available to pay for college, based on a federal formula using the information on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid).

**What this means for you:** This number determines your eligibility for need-based financial aid. Lower EFC = more aid eligibility.

**Reality Check:** Your EFC is what the government thinks your family can afford, not necessarily what they will actually pay or what college will cost.

### FAFSA
**What it is:** The Free Application for Federal Student Aid is an online form submitted annually by current and prospective college students (undergraduate and graduate) in the United States to determine eligibility for student financial aid.

**What this means for you:** This is the most important form for getting financial aid. Students who are eligible to file the FAFSA should complete it every year.

**Key point:** It's completely free to complete - never pay anyone to fill out your FAFSA.

### Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID
**What it is:** A username and password used by current and prospective students and their parents to log in to U.S. Department of Education websites including the FAFSA website. The FSA ID is used to sign documents electronically (it has the same legal status as a written signature).

**What this means for you:** You and your parents each need your own FSA ID to complete the FAFSA. Don't share these credentials with anyone.

**Important:** Keep this information secure and remember it - you'll need it every year for financial aid.

### Fee Waiver
**What it is:** Permission to not pay a fee, based on meeting some requirement or condition. In the postsecondary realm, waivers of college application fees and ACT or SAT fees are often available for students based on financial need.

**What this means for you:** If money is tight, you can often get these fees waived just by asking. This can save you hundreds of dollars.

**Pro Tip:** Ask your school counselor about fee waivers - they can help you request them.

### Financial Aid Package
**What it is:** Financial Aid Packages are also referred to as an Award Letter, Award Notice, or Financial Aid Offer. There are different types of aid including loans, work-study, scholarships, and grants.

**What this means for you:** This is your total aid offer from a school. Compare packages carefully - the school with the most aid isn't always the cheapest option overall.

**Important:** Understand the difference between grants (free money) and loans (money you repay with interest).

### Four-Year University
**What it is:** A postsecondary institution/school that offers undergraduate (bachelor's) degrees. Many four-year universities also offer graduate (master's) degrees.

**What this means for you:** These schools offer bachelor's degrees and often have more research opportunities, larger libraries, and diverse academic programs than community colleges.

**Consider this:** Four-year universities are more expensive than community colleges, but may offer more comprehensive college experiences.

### Full-time Student
**What it is:** A student who enrolls in at least a minimum number (determined by your college or university) of credit hours or courses.

**What this means for you:** Full-time status affects your financial aid eligibility and how quickly you graduate. Most schools consider 12+ credit hours full-time.

**Good to know:** Taking 15 credits per semester keeps you on track to graduate in 4 years.

### GEAR UP/Get Ready
**What it is:** Federal outreach programs providing services including professional development for counselors, improving the quality and intensity of secondary school courses, mentoring, tutoring, scholarships and financial aid, college and career planning, and parental engagement programs designed to support college planning and enrollment in specific communities.

**What this means for you:** These programs are designed to help students like you prepare for and succeed in college. Take advantage of the resources they offer!

**Reality Check:** GEAR UP coordinators are there specifically to help you navigate the college process - use them as a resource.

### Grade Point Average (GPA)
**What it is:** The average of all of the course grades a student receives in high school, or in college, on a four-point scale.

**What this means for you:** Your GPA affects college admissions, scholarships, and sometimes job opportunities. But it's not everything - don't let a low GPA stop you from pursuing your goals.

**Keep perspective:** Many successful people didn't have perfect GPAs. What matters most is that you keep learning and growing.

### Grant
**What it is:** A sum of money given by a government or other organization for a particular purpose. It does not have to be paid back.

**What this means for you:** Grants are free money for education! Federal Pell Grants are the most common, but states and schools also offer grants.

**Apply for everything:** Always accept grants when offered - there's no downside to free money for education.

### Honors Course
**What it is:** A class that covers the same subject matter as a regular class, but enriched with greater depth and at a faster pace.

**What this means for you:** Honors courses can boost your GPA and show colleges you're willing to challenge yourself, but they're not required for college admission.

**Reality Check:** Only take honors courses in subjects you're genuinely interested in - don't overload yourself just for appearances.

### International Baccalaureate (IB)
**What it is:** A curriculum of international education and rigorous assessment designed to help students develop the intellectual, personal, emotional, and social skills to live, learn, and work in a rapidly globalizing world.

**What this means for you:** IB programs are rigorous and can prepare you well for college, often earning college credit. However, they require significant commitment.

**Consider carefully:** IB programs are demanding - make sure you're ready for the workload before committing.

### Internship
**What it is:** A job in a student's field of study which may be required in some academic programs and may provide salary and/or college credit.

**What this means for you:** Internships give you real work experience in your field of interest. They're valuable for networking and figuring out what you want to do.

**Pro Tip:** Many internships lead to job offers after graduation. Treat them seriously even if they're unpaid.

### Ivy League
**What it is:** A group of long-established colleges and universities in the eastern U.S. having high academic and social prestige. It includes Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell, Brown, and the University of Pennsylvania.

**What this means for you:** These are prestigious and very competitive schools, but they're not the only path to success. Many successful people didn't attend Ivy League schools.

**Reality Check:** Ivy League schools can be great, but they're not necessary for a successful career or happy life.

### Letters of Recommendation
**What they are:** Letters of endorsement (often from high school teachers/staff) written on a student's behalf during the college and/or job application process.

**What this means for you:** These letters give admissions officers insight into your character and abilities from people who know you well.

**Pro Tip:** Ask for recommendation letters at least 3-4 weeks in advance, and provide the writer with information about what you're applying for.

## M-P

### Major
**What it is:** A concentration of study focused on a discipline, which requires completion of specific courses.

**What this means for you:** Your major is your main area of study in college. It doesn't have to directly match your future career.

### Master's Degree
**What it is:** An academic degree conferred by a college or university upon those who complete a prescribed study beyond the bachelor's degree.

**What this means for you:** Military service provides job training, education benefits, travel opportunities, and a steady income. However, it requires significant commitment and possible deployment.

**Research thoroughly:** Talk to current and former service members, not just recruiters, to understand what military life is really like.

### Minor
**What it is:** A college or university student's declared secondary academic discipline during their undergraduate studies.

**What this means for you:** A minor is a smaller concentration of study that complements your major. It's optional but can broaden your knowledge and skills.

**Good strategy:** Choose a minor that either interests you personally or complements your career goals.

### Orientation
**What it is:** A meeting/event many colleges offer (hours or days-long) where incoming students and parents/guardians receive information about registering for classes, meet their advisor, and learn about school resources and policies.

**What this means for you:** Orientation helps you transition to college life and understand how your school works. Attend if offered - it's worth your time.

**Pro Tip:** Orientation is also a great chance to meet other new students and start making friends.

**What this means for you:** Your parents can borrow money to help pay for your education, but they (not you) are responsible for repaying it.

**Important:** Parent PLUS loans have higher interest rates than student loans and fewer repayment options.

### Pell Grant
**What it is:** Money from the U.S. government to support a student's education that does not have to be paid back. Pell Grants are awarded to U.S. citizens and legal residents based on financial need and timeliness of completing the FAFSA.

**What this means for you:** This is the most common form of federal grant money. The maximum amount changes yearly, but it can cover a significant portion of community college costs.

**Apply early:** Pell Grant eligibility is based on your FAFSA, so complete it as soon as possible each year.

### Placement Test
**What it is:** Colleges and universities may require students to take tests to determine the appropriate level college math and/or English class.

**What this means for you:** These tests help ensure you're placed in classes at the right level for your skills. Don't stress about them - they're designed to help you succeed.

**Prepare lightly:** Review basic math and English skills before taking placement tests, but don't over-study.

### Postsecondary Enrollment Options (PSEO)
**What it is:** Taking classes at a college for free while in high school.

**What this means for you:** PSEO allows you to get a head start on college coursework and potentially graduate from college faster.

**Great opportunity:** PSEO can save you time and money while giving you a taste of college-level work.

**Pay attention:** Prerequisite requirements can affect how long it takes you to complete your degree.

### Residence Hall
**What it is:** A building mainly providing living or sleeping quarters for a large number of students. Also known as a dormitory and often referred to as "on-campus housing."

**What this means for you:** Living on campus can be part of the college experience, helping you make friends and stay connected to campus life.

**Consider costs:** Residence halls are convenient but often more expensive than off-campus housing options.

### Resident
**What it is:** A student who lives in and meets the residency requirements for the state where a public university is located. Tuition at public universities often is more expensive for non-residents.

**What this means for you:** In-state tuition is usually much cheaper than out-of-state tuition at public colleges and universities.

### Resume
**What it is:** A brief account of a person's education, qualifications, and previous experience, typically sent with a job application.

**What this means for you:** Your resume is your professional introduction. Even with limited experience, you can create a resume that highlights your strengths and potential.

**Commitment:** ROTC typically requires military service after graduation, so understand the commitment before joining.

### Room & Board
**What it is:** The cost of a room in a dormitory and a dining hall meal plan at a college or university.

**What this means for you:** This is a major expense beyond tuition. Look at total costs when comparing schools, not just tuition.

**Money-saving tip:** Off-campus housing and cooking your own meals can sometimes be cheaper than residence halls and meal plans.

### Salary
**What it is:** Money earned from a job.

**What this means for you:** Consider earning potential when choosing career paths, but remember that salary isn't everything - job satisfaction and work-life balance matter too.

**Research thoroughly:** Look up realistic salary ranges for careers you're considering, not just the highest possible earnings.

### Scholarship
**What it is:** Money to support a student's education that does not have to be paid back. Scholarships are awarded based on academic, athletic, artistic, or other types of achievements, affiliations, or competitions.

**What this means for you:** Scholarships are free money for education! Apply for as many as you qualify for - even small scholarships add up.

**Keep applying:** Don't stop looking for scholarships once you start college - many are available to current college students too.

### Student Aid Report (SAR)
**What it is:** The SAR summarizes the information included on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The SAR provides the Expected Family Contribution (EFC), which is used to determine whether a student is eligible for a federal Pell Grant and other federal aid.

**What this means for you:** Your SAR tells you what financial aid you're eligible for. Review it carefully and make corrections if needed.

**Important:** Your SAR is sent to the colleges you listed on your FAFSA, so they can create your financial aid package.

### Student Loan
**What it is:** Money a student borrows to help pay for college, which must be paid back. Subsidized loans are offered to students who qualify through the FAFSA. The federal government pays the interest while the student is enrolled in college at least part-time. There are also unsubsidized loans where interest begins accruing as soon as the loan is disbursed.

**What this means for you:** Loans help pay for college, but they must be repaid with interest. Only borrow what you absolutely need.

**Be careful:** Student loan debt can significantly impact your financial future. Understand the terms and total cost before borrowing.

Universities, colleges and technical schools usually require high school transcripts to be submitted as part of the application process.

**What this means for you:** Your transcript is your official academic history. Keep track of your credits and grades throughout high school.

**Important:** You'll need to request official transcripts from your school - they won't automatically be sent to colleges.

### TRiO Programs
**What they are:** Federal outreach and student support service programs at the middle school, high school, and college level to assist students with understanding of basic college requirements, and to motivate students toward successful completion of postsecondary education.

**What this means for you:** TRiO programs provide extra support for first-generation college students and those from low-income families.

**Take advantage:** If you're eligible for TRiO services, use them! They offer tutoring, mentoring, and college preparation support.

### Tuition
**What it is:** The amount of money charged for instruction/classes at postsecondary institutions (see also - cost of attendance).

**What this means for you:** Tuition is just part of college costs - you also need to budget for housing, food, books, and other expenses.

**Shop around:** Tuition varies widely between schools. Don't assume expensive schools are better or that you can't afford certain schools without checking financial aid first.

### Undeclared/Undecided
**What it is:** Term to describe a student who is unable or not ready to select a major at a college or university. Colleges typically ask students to pick their major by the end of their sophomore year.

**What this means for you:** It's completely normal to be undecided about your major when starting college. You have time to explore different subjects.

**Don't worry:** Many successful people changed majors multiple times or pursued careers unrelated to their college major.

### Work-Study
**What it is:** A federal program that provides the opportunity for college students to work part-time jobs (often on the campus of the school they attend) to earn money to pay educational expenses. Students receive compensation in the form of a paycheck, much like a traditional job. Students must submit the FAFSA to be considered for work-study positions.

**What this means for you:** Work-study provides part-time employment to help pay for college while giving you valuable work experience.

**Benefits:** Work-study jobs are designed around your class schedule and often provide flexible hours for studying.
