## Real Talk About Community College

**What people might say vs. reality:**

**"It's not real college"** → It's college. You get actual college credit.
**"You'll miss out on the experience"** → You'll save money and still get an education.
**"It's only for people who couldn't get into university"** → Lots of smart people choose this path.

**The truth:** Community college students often do better when they transfer because they've learned good study habits and know what they want.

## When You Need Help

**Talk to:**
- Community college advisors (they're usually really helpful)
- Your high school counselor
- Your GEAR UP coordinator
- Students who are already there

**Remember:** Community college staff actually want you to succeed. Don't be afraid to ask questions.
