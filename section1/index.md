## Your Timeline, Your Speed

**Not everyone moves at the same pace - find where you're at:**

{: .tip }
**🚀 Early Bird** - You're ahead of deadlines and have things figured out

{: .note }  
**⏰ Right on Time** - Following the recommended timeline and feeling good

{: .warning }
**🏃 Catching Up** - Started planning late but making moves now

{: .important }
**🚨 Crisis Mode** - It's spring senior year and you're just starting (we've got you!)

## Quick Reality Check

{: .highlight }
**Before you dive deeper, remember:**

- **You don't have to stick with your first choice forever** - most people change paths
- **Your timeline doesn't have to match your friends'** - everyone's journey is different  
- **There's no "wrong" path** - just different routes to get where you want to go
- **It's completely normal to feel nervous** about making these decisions
- **Most successful people changed careers multiple times** in their lives
