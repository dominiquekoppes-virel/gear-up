{: .label .label-green }

**Not everyone moves at the same speed, and that's okay.**

- **Early Bird** - You've got this figured out and you're ahead of deadlines  
- **Right on Time** - Following the recommended timeline  
- **Catching Up** - Started late but making moves  
- **Crisis Mode** - It's spring and you're just starting (we've all been there)

### **Whatever your situation, there's still time to make things happen.**
