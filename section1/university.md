# [U] Four-Year University Path

## First Things First

**You're thinking about university? Cool. Let's be real about what that means:**

- **4+ years of school** (some majors take longer)
- **Probably some debt** (unless you're lucky with scholarships)
- **Campus life** (if that's your thing)
- **Opens doors** to careers that typically require a degree

## Money Talk

**Let's be honest about costs:**

### Questions to Ask Each School:
- What's the **total cost** (tuition + room + food + books)?
- How much **financial aid** am I getting?
- What's my **out-of-pocket** cost per year?
- Can I work on campus?

### Keep Track:
| School | Total Cost | Aid Offered | What I Pay |
|---------|------------|-------------|------------|
| _________________ | $_______ | $_______ | $_______ |
| _________________ | $_______ | $_______ | $_______ |
| _________________ | $_______ | $_______ | $_______ |

## When You're Feeling Overwhelmed

**This is normal. Take a breath.**

**Talk to:**

- Your GEAR UP coordinator
- Family/friends who went to college
- Current college students

**Remember:**
- You don't have to be perfect
- Most schools accept most applicants
- There are multiple paths to success
- You can transfer if you hate your first choice
